TITLE(LXR Information)
<p>
 I did work hard on getting the LXR indexed sources available here,
 automatically updated from the CVS repository, but with the recent upgrade to
 perl 5.6.0 on this web server it just doesn't wanna play. I hope to replace
 it with a working source index or an equivallent service within soon.
<p>
 You'll have to settle with the <a href="/cvs.html">CVS</a> sources until then.
