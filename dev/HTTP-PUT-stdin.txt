We need to do HTTP PUT with chunked-encoding transfers when passing a file
with no known size.

1 - Add a header in the request: "Transfer-Encoding: chunked"

2 - We need to do some checks if the server doesn't deal with this properly
    (chunked is HTTP 1.1 stuff)

3 - Make a special 'write()' command that writes a buffer with a particular
    size according to the chunked spec section 3.6.1 in RFC 2616, the code
    fits in http_chunks.c
