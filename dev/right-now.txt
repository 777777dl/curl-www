Updated for March 5, 2002:

 Known problems in recent source code:

* curl_formadd() fails on OSF1. Why? Fix! Need help from OSF1 dudes.

* formpost "bug". Is this truly a bug? Should we start using
  application/octet-stream for unknown file parts within formposts?

* Running 'make test' on Mac OS X gives 4 errors. Why? At least one of these
  errors happen because the argument parsing fails! This only happen if you
  run the test suite with the curl in the source tree, if you install curl
  first and modify tests/runtests.pl to use the installed curl, it seems to
  work fine!

Work In Progress

* Kjetil Jacobsen might work on a new (simpler) data callback interface

* Ozra at grub.org might work on making timeouts on name lookups work better

* Sterling Hughes might work on unifying internal linked list usage
