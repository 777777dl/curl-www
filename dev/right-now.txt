Updated for March 5, 2002:

 Known problems in recent source code:

* Running 'make test' on Mac OS X gives 4 errors. Why? At least one of these
  errors happen because the argument parsing fails! More digging from Mac OS X
  owners is needed.  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2002-03/0000.html

* curl_formadd() fails on OSF1. Why? Fix! Need help from OSF1 dudes.

* formpost "bug". Is this truly a bug? Should we start using
  application/octet-stream for unknown file parts within formposts?

Work In Progress

* Kjetil Jacobsen might work on a new (simpler) data callback interface

* Ozra at grub.org might work on making timeouts on name lookups work better

* Sterling Hughes might work on unifying internal linked list usage
