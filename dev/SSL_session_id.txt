How to cache SSL session IDs
----------------------------

 (Ref: http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_get_session.html)

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>
 SSL_SESSION *SSL_get1_session(SSL *ssl);

Get session ID with SSL_get1_session(), as the docs says:

  "If the data is to be kept, SSL_get1_session() will increment the reference
  count and the session will stay in memory until explicitly freed with
  SSL_SESSION_free(3), regardless of its state."

  "The ssl session contains all information required to re-establish the
  connection without a new handshake."

Set session ID before a SSL_connect() attempt with SSL_set_session()

SSL_set_session(SSL *ssl, SSL_SESSION *session);
