Bjorn Reese has made the initial attempt to make an asynch name resolver. It
is available in this dev-directory using the name:

   resolver-0.2.tar.gz

We want the name resolver to:

 - work similarly with both IPv4 and IPv6 names

 - gracefully deal with libcurl being used multi-threaded

 - possible use the asynch name resolving API that the most recent versions of
   GNU libc offers (and use those funtions if they're present).
