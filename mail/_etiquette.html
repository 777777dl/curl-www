TITLE(Curl Mailing Etiquette)
<p>
 SUBTITLE(Do Not Mail a Single Individual)
<p>
 Many people send one question to one person. One person gets many mails, and
 there is only one person who can give you a reply. The question may be
 something that other people are also wanting to ask. These other people have
 no way to read the reply, but to ask the one person the question. The one
 person consequently gets overloaded with mail.
<p>
 If you <b>really</b> want to contact an individual and perhaps pay for his or
 her's services, by all means go ahead, but if it's just another curl
 question, take it to a suitable list instead.

<p>
 SUBTITLE(Subscription Required)
<p> Most, if not all, curl mailing lists require that you are subscribed to
 allow a mail to go through to all the subscribers.
<p> If you post without being subscribed (or from a different mail address
 than the one you are subscribed as), your mail will be held until an admin
 either approves or discards it.
<p> The reason for this subscription policy is of course the internet decease
called spam.

<p>
 SUBTITLE(Reply or New Mail)
<p>
 Please do not reply to an existing message as a short-cut to post a message
 to the lists. Many mail programs and web archivers use information within
 mails to keep them together as "threads", as collections of posts that
 discuss a certain subject. If you don't intend to reply on the same or
 similar subject, don't just hit reply on an existing mail and change subject,
 create a new mail.

<p>
 SUBTITLE(Reply to the List)
<p>
 When replying to a message from the list, make sure that you do "group reply"
 or "reply to all", and not just reply to the author of the single mail you
 reply to.
<p>
 We're actively discouraging replying back to the single person by setting the
 Reply-To: field in outgoing mails back to the mailing list address, making it
 harder for people to mail the author only by mistake.

<p>
 SUBTITLE(HTML is not for mails)
<p>
 Please switch off those HTML encoded messages. You can mail all those funny
 mails to your friends. We speak plain text mails here.
