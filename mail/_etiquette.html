TITLE(Curl Mailing Etiquette)
<a name="single"></a>
<p>
 SUBTITLE(Do Not Mail a Single Individual)
<p>
 Many people send one question to one person. One person gets many mails, and
 there is only one person who can give you a reply. The question may be
 something that other people are also wanting to ask. These other people have
 no way to read the reply, but to ask the one person the question. The one
 person consequently gets overloaded with mail.
<p>
 If you <b>really</b> want to contact an individual and perhaps pay for his or
 her's services, by all means go ahead, but if it's just another curl
 question, take it to a suitable list instead.

<a name="subscribe"></a>
<p>
 SUBTITLE(Subscription Required)
<p> All curl mailing lists require that you are subscribed to allow a mail to
 go through to all the subscribers.

<p> If you post without being subscribed (or from a different mail address
 than the one you are subscribed with), your mail will simply be silently
 discarded. You <b>have to</b> subscribe first, then post.

<p> The reason for this strict subscription policy is of course to stop spam
from pestering the lists.

<a name="reply"></a>
<p>
 SUBTITLE(Reply or New Mail)
<p>
 Please do not reply to an existing message as a short-cut to post a message
 to the lists. Many mail programs and web archivers use information within
 mails to keep them together as "threads", as collections of posts that
 discuss a certain subject. If you don't intend to reply on the same or
 similar subject, don't just hit reply on an existing mail and change subject,
 create a new mail.

<a name="list"></a>
<p>
 SUBTITLE(Reply to the List)
<p>
 When replying to a message from the list, make sure that you do "group reply"
 or "reply to all", and not just reply to the author of the single mail you
 reply to.
<p>
 We're actively discouraging replying back to the single person by setting the
 Reply-To: field in outgoing mails back to the mailing list address, making it
 harder for people to mail the author only by mistake.

<a name="subject"></a>
<p>
 SUBTITLE(Use a Sensible Subject)
<p>
 Please use a subject of the mail that makes sense and that is related to the
 contents of your mail. It makes it a lot easier to find your mail afterwards
 and it makes it easier to track mail threads and topics.

<a name="top-post"></a>
<p>
 SUBTITLE(Do Not Top-Post)
<p>
 If you reply to a message, don't use top-posting. Top-posting is when you
 write the new text at the top of a mail and you insert the previous quoted
 mail conversation below. It forces users to read the mail in a backwards
 order to properly understand it.

<p>
 This is why top posting is so bad:
<blockquote>
<pre>
 A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read
    text.
 Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
 A: Top-posting.
 Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Apart from the screwed up read order (especially when mixed together in a
 thread when some responds doing the mandaded bottom-posting style), it also
 makes it impossible to quote only parts of the original mail.

<p>
 When you reply to a mail. You let the mail client insert the previous mail
 quoted. Then you put the cursor on the <b>first</b> line of the mail and you
 move down through the mail, deleting all parts of the quotes that don't add
 context for your comments. When you want to add a comment you do so, inline,
 right after the quotes that relate to your comment. Then you continue
 downwards again.

<p>
 When most of the quotes have been removed and you've added your own words,
 you're done!

<a name="html"></a>
<p>
 SUBTITLE(HTML is not for mails)
<p>
 Please switch off those HTML encoded messages. You can mail all those funny
 mails to your friends. We speak plain text mails here.

<a name="quote"></a>
<p>
SUBTITLE(Quoting)
<p>
 <a href="http://www.netmeister.org/news/learn2quote.html">How do I quote
 correctly</a>

<a name="digest"></a>
<p>
SUBTITLE(Digest)
<p>
 We allow subscribers to subscribe to the "digest" version of the mailing
 lists. A digest is a collection of mails lumped together in one single mail.
<p>
 Should you decide to reply to a mail sent out as a digest, there are two
 things you MUST consider if you really really cannot subscribe normally
 instead:

<ol>
<li> cut off all mails and chatter that is not related to the mail you want to reply to.
<li> change the subject name to something sensible and related to the subject, preferably even the actual subject of the single mail you wanted to reply to
</ol>

<a name="tell"></a>
<p>
 SUBTITLE(Please Tell Us How You Solved The Problem!)
<p>
 Many people mail questions to the list, people spend some of their time and
 make an effort in providing good answers to these questions.
<p> If you are the one who asks, please consider responding once more in case
 one of the hints was what solved your problems. The guys who write answers
 feel good to know that they provided a good answer and that you fixed the
 problem. Far too often, the person who asked the question is never heard of
 again, and we never get to know if he/she is gone because the problem was
 solved or perhaps because the problem was unsolvable!
<p> Getting the solution posted also helps other users that experience the
 same problem(s). They get to see (possibly in the web archives) that the
 suggested fixes actually has helped at least one person.
