TITLE(Curl Mirrors)

<p>
 Previously we had a system with web site mirroring. We no longer provide any
 links to any such web sites because it turned out to be too tedious and we
 had too much problems with mirrors to stay in sync.

<p> Try the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/latest.cgi">recent archives</a> page
to pick your favorite curl archive from a mirror we know has it!

<p>
  <b>If you run or plan to run a mirror not mentioned here, please let <a
  href="mailto:curl-web_at_haxx.se">us</a> know!</b>. Mirroring info and tools
  are <a href="/mirror/">here</a>.
