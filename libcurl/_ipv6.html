TITLE(libcurl - supports IPv6)
<p>
 If compiled with IPv6 support enabled, FTP, HTTP and HTTPS all work
 splendidly on IPv6 stacks (kerberos4 does not work over IPv6 by design).

<p> There is nothing in particular needed to get IPv6 to be used, the library
API remains exactly the same and adjusts to IPv4/Ipv6 dynamicly. You can use
host names that only have AAAA DNS records, or you can use IPv6 IP-only style
addresses like <tt>[::1]</tt>.
