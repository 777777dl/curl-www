<a name="reliable"></a>
SUBTITLE(Solid and Reliable!)
<p>
 libcurl was released in its current "incarnation" in the year 2000 and it has
 been in constant use by a large number of <a
 href="using/apps.html">applications</a> and <a
 href="/docs/companies.html">companies</a> ever since. Sure there have been
 bugs and even a few <a href="/docs/security.html">security-related</a> flaws,
 but it has remained a very solid and reliable library and lots of users are
 still using libcurl versions released many years ago as they stick with what
 works.

<a name="widelyused"></a>
SUBTITLE(Widely Used!)
<p>
 libcurl is the most used C-based highly portable transfer library in the
 world. Some of the world's biggest <a
 href="/docs/companies.html">companies</a> use libcurl in high volume
 applications. Some of the open source <a
 href="using/apps.html">applications</a> using libcurl are very widely used.
<p>
 We estimate that the amount of users who frequently use (lib)curl, knowingly
 or not, is well over one million.

<a name="portable"></a>
SUBTITLE(Portable!)
<p>
 libcurl has been ported to numerous platforms and CPUs. libcurl offers the
 same API and feature set on all of them! Using libcurl assures you that you
 can write your application to work on very large amount of systems, including
 but not limited to Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, HPUX, IRIX,
 AIX, Tru64, Linux, UnixWare, HURD, Windows, Amiga, OS/2, BeOs, Mac OS X,
 Ultrix, QNX, OpenVMS, RISC OS, Novell NetWare, DOS and more...

<a name="thread"></a>
SUBTITLE(Thread Safe!)
<p>
 libcurl is designed and implemented entirely thread safe. There are some
 considerations to keep in mind when using libcurl in multiple threads though,
 as mentioned below:
<p>
 <b>Never</b> share libcurl handles between multiple threads. You should only
 use one handle in one single thread at any given time. You can still share
 certain data between multiple threads by using the <a
 href="/libcurl/c/libcurl-share.html">share interface</a>.
<p>
 libcurl uses certain system calls to obtain information. Some of the most
 crucial ones are the name resoluition calls (the <i>gethostby*</i>
 family). It is very important that libcurl found and can use thread safe
 versions of these and other system calls, as otherwise it can't function
 fully thread safe.
<p>
 Some operating systems are known to have faulty thread implementations. We
 have previously received problem reports on *BSD (at least in the past, they
 may be working fine these days). Some operating systems that are known to
 have solid and working thread support are Linux, Solaris and Windows.
<p>
 Further, if you use any SSL/TLS-based protocol (HTTPS or FTPS) you need to
 setup OpenSSL or GnuTLS callbacks for synch. See the <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-tutorial.html#Multi-threading">libcurl-tutorial(3)</a>
 man page for details.


<a name="features"></a>
SUBTITLE(Unmatched Set of Features!)
<p>
 There simply is no other HTTP and FTP library that can boast the same amount
 and set of <a href="/docs/features.html">features</a> that libcurl does. Be
 it free or commercial.
<p>
 Also, libcurl's unique offer of both a pull and push interface allows
 applications to use it exactly the way they please.

<p>
 libcurl also offers an unmatched set of bindings, enabling you to access and
 use libcurl from basically whatever language you can think of!

<a name="ipv6"></a>
SUBTITLE(Supports IPv6!)
<p>
 If compiled with IPv6 support enabled, FTP, FTPS, HTTP and HTTPS all work
 splendidly on IPv6 stacks (kerberos4 does not work over IPv6 by design).

<p> There is nothing in particular needed to get IPv6 to be used, the library
 API remains exactly the same and adjusts to IPv4/Ipv6 dynamicly. You can use
 host names that only have AAAA DNS records, or you can use IPv6 IP-only style
 addresses like <tt>[::1]</tt>.

<a name="support"></a>
SUBTITLE(Well Supported!)
<p>
 We claim libcurl is well supported because you can get help on one of the
 mailing lists, very quickly and accurately. Often within a few hours. Having
 the mailing list archives available on the web also makes them searchable and
 allows you to find already mentioned solutions and answers.
<p>
 We have a public bug tracker and known bugs are mostly fixed very swiftly.
<p>
 We also provide very detailed documentation on all operations, not just in
 every release archive but also available on the web site(s).
<p>
 You can get paid support from one of the listed <a href="/support.html">curl
 support</a> companies.
<p>
 Since the code is free and available, any skilled programmer can fix and
 improve the tool and library whenever. If you can't, you can hire one!

<a name="fast"></a>
SUBTITLE(Fast!)
<p>
 Tests performed by independent users, have proved libcurl to be equally fast,
 up to a lot faster than <a href="libwww.html">libwww</a> in comparable test
 cases.
<p>
 When using libcurl bindings, you will get unmatched speeds due to libcurl
 being programmed in C and very often the language-specific alternatives (be
 it perl, Python, PHP, tcl or whatever) are <i>much</i> slower.
<p>
 TODO: add references to hard facts here. <i>If you have any or know any
 comparisons with real-world numbers, then please let <a
 href="mailto:curl-web@haxx.se">us</a> know!</i>

<a name="docs"></a>
SUBTITLE(Thoroughly Documented!)
<p> All functions in libcurl have their own detailed <a
 href="/libcurl/c/allfuncs.html">man pages</a> describing their actual
 functionality and purpose.

<p> All interfaces have overview-style man pages describing the concepts that
 glue all the functions together: <a
 href="/libcurl/c/libcurl-easy.html">easy</a>, <a
 href="/libcurl/c/libcurl-multi.html">multi</a> and <a
 href="/libcurl/c/libcurl-share.html">share</a>.

<p> There is a <a href="/libcurl/c/libcurl-tutorial.html">libcurl tutorial</a>.

<p> We have numerous commented <a href="/libcurl/c/example.html">source code
examples</a>.
