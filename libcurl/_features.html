SUBTITLE(Thread Safe)
<p>
<p>
 libcurl is designed and implemented entirely thread safe. There are some
 considerations to keep in mind when using libcurl in multiple threads though,
 as mentioned below:
<p>
 <b>Never</b> share libcurl handles between multiple threads. You should only
 use one handle in one single thread at any given time. You can still share
 certain data between multiple threads by using the <a
 href="/libcurl/c/libcurl-share.html">share interface</a>.
<p>
 libcurl uses certain system calls to obtain information. Some of the most
 crucial ones are the name resoluition calls (the <i>gethostby*</i>
 family). It is very important that libcurl found and can use thread safe
 versions of these and other system calls, as otherwise it can't function
 fully thread safe.
<p>
 Some operating systems are known to have faulty thread implementations. We
 have previously received problem reports on *BSD (at least in the past, they
 may be working fine these days). Some operating systems that are known to
 have solid and working thread support are Linux, Solaris and Windows.
<p>
 Further, if you use any SSL/TLS-based protocol (HTTPS or FTPS) you need to
 setup OpenSSL or GnuTLS callbacks for synch. See the <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-tutorial.html#Multi-threading">libcurl-tutorial(3)</a>
 man page for details.


<a name="features"></a>
SUBTITLE(Unmatched Set of Features)
<p>
 There simply is no other HTTP and FTP library that can boast the same amount
 and set of <a href="/docs/features.html">features</a> that libcurl does. Be
 it free or commercial.

<a name="ipv6"></a>
SUBTITLE(Supports IPv6)
<p>
 If compiled with IPv6 support enabled, FTP, FTPS, HTTP and HTTPS all work
 splendidly on IPv6 stacks (kerberos4 does not work over IPv6 by design).

<p> There is nothing in particular needed to get IPv6 to be used, the library
API remains exactly the same and adjusts to IPv4/Ipv6 dynamicly. You can use
host names that only have AAAA DNS records, or you can use IPv6 IP-only style
addresses like <tt>[::1]</tt>.

<a name="support"></a>
SUBTITLE(Well Supported)
<p>
 We claim libcurl is well supported because you can get help on one of the
 mailing lists, very quickly and accurately. Often within a few hours. Having
 the mailing list archives available on the web also makes them searchable and
 allows you to find already mentioned solutions and answers.
<p>
 We also provide very detailed documentation on all operations, not just in
 every release archive but also available on the web site(s).
<p>
 You can get support from one of the listed <a href="/support.html">curl
 support</a> companies.
<p>
 Since the code is free and available, any skilled programmer can fix and
 improve the tool and library whenever. If you can't, you can hire one!

<a name="fast"></a>
SUBTITLE(Fast!)
<p>
 Tests performed by independent users, have proved libcurl to be equally fast,
 up to a lot faster than <a href="libwww.html">libwww</a> in comparable test
 cases.
<p>
 TODO: add references to hard facts here. If you have any or know any
 comparisons with real-world numbers, then please let us know!

<a name="docs"></a>
SUBTITLE(Thoroughly Documented)
<p> All functions have their own detailed <a
 href="/libcurl/c/allfuncs.html">man pages</a> describing their actual
 functionality and purpose.
<p> All interfaces have overview-style man pages describing concepts that glue
 functions together: <a href="/libcurl/c/libcurl-easy.html">easy</a>, <a
 href="/libcurl/c/libcurl-multi.html">multi</a> and <a
 href="/libcurl/c/libcurl-share.html">share</a>.
<p> There is a <a
href="/libcurl/c/libcurl-tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.
<p> We have numerous commented <a href="/libcurl/c/example.html">source code
examples</a>.
