<ul>

 <li> libcurl is (far) more portable

 <li> libsoup lacks support for: cookies, NTLM for proxies
 (Proxy-Authentication:), GSS, gzip encoding, trailers in chunked responses
 and more that libcurl already provides.

 <li> libsoup is using GNOME-related libs, making it a less convenient choice
 for non-GNOME environments.
