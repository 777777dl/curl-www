<ul>

 <li> there's a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q238425/">tech note
 from Microsoft</a> that says not to use WinInet from system context.

 <li> Even if you ignore the tech note, there are a bunch of annoyances with
 using WinInet from system context.  The biggest of which is proxy settings.
 In general, the settings are stored per user, so if you find yourself in
 system context, the correct settings may not be there.  Or, if you need to
 impersonate another user, you're in the same boat.  Gotta love the plain text
 config file.  I am curious if people worry about their proxy credentials
 lying around in plain text, or if they encrypt them, or what.

 <li> Even with the correct settings, there are certain versions of IE (I
 think it's 6, and maybe with some service packs) that don't work properly
 when communicating to proxies with basic authentication.

 <li> There are so many sweet features with curl that I doubt are available
 with WinInet.  I'm using the curl executable, so I get bandwidth limiting
 which isn't in the library, but --speed-time and --speed-limit are great.

 <li> I've never tried to deal with Microsoft for WinInet support, but the
 curl support (i.e. the <a href="/mail/">libcurl mailing list</a>, and Daniel
 in particular) is <i>really</i> good.

 <li> Even if portability isn't a concern now, it might be later.  And,
 there's more than just code portability.  If you get good with curl, you'll
 have a useful skill if you work on other platforms.  I doubt we'll see
 WinInet ported anywhere else anytime soon.
