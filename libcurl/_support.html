TITLE(libcurl - Support)
<p>
 We claim libcurl is well supported because you can get help on one of the
 mailing lists, very quickly and accurately. Often within a few hours. Having
 the mailing list archives available on the web also makes them searchable and
 allows you to find already mentioned solutions and answers.
<p>
 We also provide very detailed documentation on all operations, not just in
 every release archive but also available on the web site(s).
<p>
 You can get support from one of the listed <a href="/support.html">curl
 support</a> companies.
<p>
 Since the code is free and available, any skilled programmer can fix and
 improve the tool and library whenever. If you can't, you can hire one!
