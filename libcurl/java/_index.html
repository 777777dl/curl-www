TITLE(accessing libcurl from Java)
<p>
 libcurl is a solid and reliable multi-protocol file transfer library for URL
 syntax defined files. We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within
 our Java programs.

<p>
 All you need to do is to install the 'javacurl' package and then you'll be
 able to use it.

<p>
 This interface is still very basic. We need your input and suggestions on how
 to develop this further!

<p><b>How to Install</b></br>

 Install curl and libcurl first. Manual hands-on installation is required for
 the actual java interface module.

<p><b>Examples</b><br> Please post any examples you've made, as I have none!

<p><b>Interface documentation</b><br> None available right now.

<p><b>Download</b><br> Download the <a href="java-0.1.tar.gz">version 0.1</a>
 (5KB) or browse the <a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/curl/java/">source
 files</a>.
