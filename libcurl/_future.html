TITLE(Future)
<p>
 We're starting to talk and plan for a future curl and libcurl version 8.
<p>
 Everything in the crrent libcurl is now subject for discussions around what
 to keep, what to improve, what to add and what to remove. If you object to
 any of the points below, make your voice heard and tell us your view!
<p>
SUBTITLE(subject for removal in v8)
<p>
<ul>
<li> DICT support
</ul>
<p>
SUBTITLE(subject for improvement in v8)
<p>
<ul>
<li> LDAP support.
</ul>
SUBTITLE(subject for addition in v8)
<p>
<ul>
<li> the multi interface
<li> NTLM support
<li> shareable connection pool
<li> DNS caching
<li> asynch DNS lookups
</ul>

TITLE(multi API)
<p>
 We intend to add a new interface to libcurl, an interface that allows the
 calling application to "drive". We call that a "pull" interface.

<p> This was once upon the time dicussed, calling it a "low level"
 interface. It was brought up again during the autumn 2001 and we have now
 refined our ideas and our thoughts are now gathered around the "multi"
 interface.
<p>
 This interface makes it very easy to transfer multiple files simultaneously,
 while also allowing the application to do stuff in the mean time. All this
 without using multiple threads.

SUBTITLE(header and initial source code)
<p>
 We have started working on the <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/lib/multi.h">multi.h</a> header file,
 which also pretty much contains all the docs there is yet.  The <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/lib/multi.c">multi.c</a> file is to be
 filled in with (more) source code.

SUBTITLE(example using this interface)
<p>
 The imaginary <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/dev/multi-app.c">multi-app.c</a>
 is application source code, showing how this interface could be used.

<p>
 Bring your ideas and energy to the libcurl mailing list!
