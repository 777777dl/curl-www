TITLE(Future)

<p>
 We need to add a new interface to libcurl, an interface that allows the
 calling application to "drive". We call that a "pull" interface.

<p> This was once upon the time dicussed, calling it a "low level"
 interface. It was brought up again during the autumn 2001 and we have now
 refined the ideas and our thoughts are now gathered around the "multi"
 interface.

<p>
 We have a simple, imaginary <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/dev/multi.h">multi.h</a> header file, and an
 associated similarly imaginary <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/dev/multi-app.c">multi-app.c</a> application source
 code, showing how this interface could be made to work.

<p>
 No code has yet been written to make this come real.

<p>
 Bring your ideas and energy to the libcurl mailing list!
