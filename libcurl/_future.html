TITLE(Future)
<p>
 We intend to add a new interface to libcurl, an interface that allows the
 calling application to "drive". We call that a "pull" interface.

<p> This was once upon the time dicussed, calling it a "low level"
 interface. It was brought up again during the autumn 2001 and we have now
 refined our ideas and our thoughts are now gathered around the "multi"
 interface.

SUBTITLE(header)
<p>
 We have started working on the <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/lib/multi.h">multi.h</a> header file,
 which also pretty much contains all the docs there is yet.

SUBTITLE(source)
<p>
 The <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/lib/multi.c">multi.c</a> file is
 to be filled in with source code.

SUBTITLE(example using this interface)
<p>
 The imaginary <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/dev/multi-app.c">multi-app.c</a>
 is application source code, showing how this interface could be used.

<p>
 Bring your ideas and energy to the libcurl mailing list!
