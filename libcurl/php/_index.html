TITLE(CURL -- accessing libcurl from PHP)
<p>
 We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within PHP programs. Curl is
 supported built-in since PHP 4.0.2, no extra stuff is needed but the PHP and
 curl packages.

<p>
 All you need to do is to configure PHP with curl awareness on build time, and
 you'll get a set of extra functions to use.

<p>
 <b>How to Install?</b><br> You need to enable the curl support when you build
 PHP: <a href="install.html">install the curl-PHP binding</a>. There's also
 the document with <a href="iis.html">hints on how to install PHP/CURL on
 IIS</a>.

<p>
 <b>Applications</b><br>
 We collect a <a href="apps.html">list of PHP applications powered by curl</a>.

<p>
 <b>Examples</b><br> We keep a few <a href="examples/">example source codes</a>
 on this site for your pleasure.

 how he used curl to communicate with a credit card payment site with PHP.
