TITLE(PHP/CURL -- accessing libcurl from PHP)
<p>
 We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within PHP programs. PHP/CURL
 is supported built-in since PHP 4.0.2, no extra stuff is needed but PHP
 and libcurl installed.

<p>
 <big><em>PHP/CURL is a binding that uses libcurl. It means that the PHP team
 has written a glue layer for PHP that speaks to the underlying libcurl. That
 layer, the binding, is what we call PHP/CURL and that is what offers the
 functions named curl_* within the PHP language for you. The PHP/CURL binding
 is written, maintained and being provided by the PHP team and you <b>will
 not</b> find any binaries, DLLs or other packages for it on this
 site.</em></big>

 <b>How to Install?</b><br>

 The primary site for all things PHP is of course the <a
 href="http://www.php.net/">www.php.net</a> site. See their <a
 href="http://www.php.net/curl">PHP/CURL section</a> for details.
<p>
 (If you for some reason still don't read the instructions on the php.net
 site...) You need to enable the PHP/CURL support when you build PHP: <a
 href="install.html">install PHP/CURL</a>. There's also the
 document with <a href="iis.html">hints on how to install PHP/CURL on IIS</a>.

<p>
 <b>Applications</b><br> We collect a <a href="apps.html">list of PHP/CURL
 powered applications</a>.

<p>
 <b>Docs and Examples</b>
<br>
 The <a
 href="http://www.php.net/manual/ref.curl.php">PHP/CURL binding
 description</a> is found on the PHP site.
<p>
 We host a few <a href="examples/">example sources</a>.

 Michael Reynolds wrote an article on <a

 how he used curl (the command line tool) to communicate with a credit card
 payment site with PHP.
