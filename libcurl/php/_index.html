TITLE(CURL -- accessing libcurl from PHP)
<p>
 libcurl is a solid and reliable multi-protocol file transfer library for URL
 syntax defined files. We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within
 our PHP programs. Curl is supported built-in since PHP 4.0.2, no extra stuff
 is needed but the PHP and curl packages.
<p>
 All you need to do is to configure PHP with curl awareness on build time, and
 you'll get a set of extra functions to use.
<p>
 <font color="red">Problems with PHP4.0.6?</font> Many people seem to
 experience such. One way to fix this, is upgrading to PHP 4.1.0!

<p>
 <b>How to Install?</b><br>
 You need to enable the curl support when you build PHP: <a
 href="install.html">install the curl-PHP interface</a>.

<p>
 <b>Applications</b><br>
 We collect a <a href="apps.html">list of PHP applications powered by curl</a>.

<p>
 <b>Examples</b><br> We keep a few <a href="examples/">example source codes</a>
 on this site for your pleasure.
<p>
 Michael Reynolds wrote an article on <a
 href="http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/michael20010510.php3">phpbuilder.com</a>
 how he used curl to communicate with a credit card payment site with PHP.
<p>
 <b>Interface documentation</b><br> The <a
 href="http://www.php.net/manual/ref.curl.php">PHP/curl interface
 description</a> is found on the PHP site.

<p><b>Mailing List</b><br> We have this special-purpose mailing list for PHP
 and curl related issues. (<a
