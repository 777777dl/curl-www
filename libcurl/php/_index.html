TITLE(CURL -- accessing libcurl from PHP)
<p>
 libcurl is a solid and reliable multi-protocol file transfer library for URL
 syntax defined files. We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within
 our PHP programs. Curl is supported built-in since PHP 4.0.2, no extra stuff
 is needed but the PHP and curl packages.
<p>
 All you need to do is to configure PHP with curl awareness on build time, and
 you'll get a set of extra functions to use.
<p>
 <b>How to Install?</b><br>
 You need to enable the curl support when you build PHP: <a
 href="install.html">install the curl-PHP interface</a>.

<p>
 <b>Application</b><br>
 We collect a <a href="apps.html">list of PHP applications powered by curl</a>.

<p>
 <b>Examples</b><br> There are a few tiny example source codes in the <a
 href="/lxr/source/php/examples/">/php/examples/</a> directory.
