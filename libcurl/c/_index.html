WHERE2(libcurl, "/libcurl/", C Interface Overview)

TITLE(Using The libcurl C Interface)
<p>
 There's the tutorial to start with, read <a href="libcurl-tutorial.html">the
 tutorial</a> to get a general in-depth grip of what libcurl programming is
 all about.
<p>
 There are some <a href="example.html">example C source codes</a> you can
 check out. They're not all-covering or even very extensive, but they might
 serve as a source of inspiration to start hacking.
<p>
 Windows developers using the Microsoft Visual Studio, might enjoy Rosso
 Salmanzadeh's excellent <a href="visual_studio.pdf">Using libcurl in Visual
 Studio</a> [PDF] guide.

TITLE(Easy or Multi)
<p>
 The easy interface is a synchronous, efficient, quickly used and... yes, easy
 interface for file transfers. Numerous applications have been built using
 this.
<p>
 The multi interface is the asynchronous brother in the family and it also
 offers multiple transfers using a single thread and more. Get a grip of how
 to work with it in <a href="libcurl-multi.html">the multi interface
 overview</a>.

TITLE(The Easy interface)
<p>
 When using libcurl you <a href="curl_easy_init.html">init</a> your
 easy-session and get a handle, which you use as input to the following
 interface functions you use.
<p>
 You continue by setting all the <a href="curl_easy_setopt.html">options</a>
 you want in the upcoming transfer, most important among them is the URL
 itself. You might want to set some callbacks as well that will be called from
 the library when data is available etc.
<p>
 When all is setup, you tell libcurl to <a
 href="curl_easy_perform.html">perform</a> the transfer. It will then do the
 entire operation and won't return until it is done or failed.
<p>
 After the performance is made, you may <a href="curl_easy_getinfo.html">get
 information</a> about the transfer and then you <a
 href="curl_easy_cleanup.html">cleanup</a> the easy-session's handle and
 libcurl is entire off the hook!
<p>

 While the above functions are the main functions to use in the easy
 interface, there is a series of other helpful functions too including:
