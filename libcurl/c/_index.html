WHERE2(libcurl, "/libcurl/", C Interface Overview)

TITLE(Using The libcurl C Interface)
<p>
 There's the tutorial to start with, read <a href="the-guide.html">The
 Guide</a> to get a general in-depth grip of what libcurl programming is all
 about.
<p>
 There are some <a href="example.shtml">example C source codes</a> you can
 check out. They're not all-covering or even very extensive, but they might
 serve as a source of inspiration to start hacking.
<p>
 Windows developers using the Microsoft Visual Studio, might enjoy Rosso
 Salmanzadeh's excellent <a href="visual_studio.pdf">Using libcurl in Visual
 Studio</a> [PDF] guide.

TITLE(Going Easy or Going Multi)
<p>
 libcurl has offered the "easy" interface for file transfers since libcurl
 version 7 was released the first time, during spring year 2000. The easy
 interface is a synchronous, efficient, quickly used and... yes, easy
 interface for file transfers. Numerous applications have been built using
 this.
<p>
 As of recent releases, we have started to put focus more and more on the new
 interface, the so called "multi" interface. The multi interface is the
 asynchronous brother in the family and it also offers multiple transfers
 using a single thread and more. The multi interface's documentation is still
 not available on the web site, but the man pages are included in the curl
 release archives starting with 7.9.6. You can also read <a
 href="libcurl-multi.html">the multi interface overview</a>.

TITLE(The Easy interface)
<p>
 When using libcurl you <a href="curl_easy_init.html">init</a> your
 easy-session and get a handle, which you use as input to the following
 interface functions you use.
<p>
 You continue by setting all the <a href="curl_easy_setopt.html">options</a>
 you want in the upcoming transfer, most important among them is the URL
 itself. You might want to set some callbacks as well that will be called from
 the library when data is available etc.
<p>
 When all is setup, you tell libcurl to <a
 href="curl_easy_perform.html">perform</a> the transfer. It will then do the
 entire operation and won't return until it is done or failed.
<p>
 After the performance is made, you may <a href="curl_easy_getinfo.html">get
 information</a> about the transfer and then you <a
 href="curl_easy_cleanup.html">cleanup</a> the easy-session's handle and
 libcurl is entire off the hook!
<p>
 <a href="curl_easy_init.html">curl_easy_init()</a>
<br>
 <a href="curl_easy_cleanup.html">curl_easy_cleanup()</a>
<br>
 <a href="curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt()</a>
<br>
 <a href="curl_easy_perform.html">curl_easy_perform()</a>
<br>
 <a href="curl_easy_getinfo.html">curl_easy_getinfo()</a>
<p>
 While the above functions are the main functions to use in the easy
 interface, there is a series of other helpful functions too. They are:
<p>

  <a href="curl_version.html">curl_version()</a>

 For your pleasure, all the libcurl man pages for the C API are available as

<a href="
<!--#exec cmd="./htmllink.cgi" -->
">HTML pages</a>. Note that this package is rebuilt whenever these pages are
updated. (Hence the date-stamp in the file name)
<p>
 All man pages are included in every release archive, both man page formatted
 and HTML formatted.
