 This whole section of the curl web site is dedicated to libcurl, and it
 contains detailed information on how to use libcurl in your own applications
 using your prefered programming language. Checkout the many bindings
 available in the left-side menu.
<p>
 Go to the regular curl <a href="/download.html">download page</a> and get the
 latest curl package.  There is no separate package with only libcurl, but
 there are some binary development packages in the regular curl download
 section you might opt for. All source and devel packages include libcurl (the
 binary ones does too, but some of them have it staticly linked into curl). In
 fact, libcurl is the major part of curl.
<p>
 Many <a href="using/apps.html">applications are powered by libcurl</a> and
 many <a href="/docs/companies.html">companies</a> already rely on libcurl for
 transfers. Check out our <a href="using/">using libcurl</a> page for general
 hints and advice.
