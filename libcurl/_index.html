 Go to the regular curl <a href="/download.html">download page</a> and get the
 latest curl package.  There is no separate package with only libcurl, but
 there are some binary development packages in the regular curl download
 section you might opt for. All source and devel packages include libcurl (the
 binary ones does too, but some of them have it staticly linked into curl). In
 fact, libcurl is the major part of curl.
