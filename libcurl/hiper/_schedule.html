START

 MARKDATE(Dec 2 2005) Made a script that figuered out a few thousand "random"
 URLs.<p>Started writing a test application using the existing multi
 interface. It fetches N simultaneous URLs and measures how long time is spent
 in the curl_multi_perform() calls. With "just" 100 simultaneous downloads the
 time spent is very small so I guess I need to up the timer resolution and use
 many more simultaneous transfers. Since my goal is to increase performance
 when very many transfers <i>are in progress</i> I need to somehow weight the
 stats counters to consider the amount of current transfers.
 <p>
 I've decided I'll commit/shouw my test program(s) as soon as I have something
 that actually show numbers I trust and are reliable.
