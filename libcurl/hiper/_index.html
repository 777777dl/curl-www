TITLE(High Performance libcurl)
<p>
  Hiper is the name of the sub-project that intends to bring high performance
  adjustments and additions to the libcurl multi interface.
<p>
  The aim is to 1) provide a better API for _extremely_ large amounts of
  simultaneous transfers (the c10k problem) and 2) introduce HTTP pipelining
  support. By better API, we mean both better suited to deal with the amount
  of connections (i.e no artificial limits like select() imposes etc), better
  performance-wise by avoiding expensive looping over all file descriptors to
  check for actions and to allow users to pick an underlying event system of
  their own choice.
<p>
SUBTITLE(Schedule)
<p>
  Daniel intends to work more or less full-time with the Hiper project during
  December 2005. Leftovers will be done part-time in 2006 with possibly some
  further full-time periods during spring 2006.
<p>
  I'll get back with more specific (release) dates later on.

SUBTITLE(Funding)
<p>
  Daniel receives funding from the Swedish foundation IIS for the purpose of
  implementing this.

SUBTITLE(Project Involvement)
<p>
  The plan is to keep the process and progress as open and public as I
  possibly can, to allow anyone and everyone who feels like contributing or
  just watching to do so. This is still curl, this is still open source and I
  still value and appreciate all user feedback and comments.

SUBTITLE(Source Code Repository)
<p>
  For the sake of being able to be 100% public and open, I will create a
  branch in the CVS repository so that the Hiper experiments and developments
  won't interfere with the "normal" libcurl development.
