TITLE(libcurl - a thread safe transfer library)
<p>
 libcurl is designed and implemented entirely thread safe. There are some
 considerations to keep in mind when using libcurl in multiple threads though,
 as mentioned below:
<p>
 <b>Never</b> share easy handles between multiple threads. You should only use
 one easy handle in one single thread at any given time. You can still share
 certain data between multiple threads by using the <a
 href="/libcurl/c/libcurl-share.html">share interface</a>.
<p>
 libcurl uses certain system calls to obtain information. Some of the most
 crucial ones are the name resoluition calls (the <i>gethostby*</i>
 family). It is very important that libcurl found and can use thread safe
 versions of these and other system calls, as otherwise it can't function
 fully thread safe.
<p>
 Some operating systems are known to have faulty thread implementations. We
 have previously received problem reports on *BSD. Some operating systems that
 are known to have solid and working thread support are Linux, Solaris and
 Windows.
<p>
 Further, if you use any SSL-based protocol you need to setup OpenSSL
 callbacks for synch. See the libcurl-tutorial(3) man page for details.
