TITLE(libcurl - a thread safe transfer library)
<p>
 libcurl is designed and implemented entirely thread safe. There are some
 considerations to keep in mind when using libcurl in multiple threads though,
 as mentioned below:
<p>
 <b>Never</b> share easy handles between multiple threads. You should only use
 one easy handle in one single thread at any given time.
<p>
 libcurl uses certain system calls to obtain information. Some of the most
 crucial ones are the name resoluition calls (the <i>gethostby*</i>
 family). It is very important that libcurl found and can use thread safe
 versions of these and other system calls, as otherwise it can't function
 fully thread safe.
<p>
 Some operating systems are known to have faulty thread implementations. We
 have previously received problem reports on *BSD. Some operating systems that
 are known to have solid and working thread support are Linux, Solaris and
 Windows.
