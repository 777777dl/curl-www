TITLE(Curl::easy -- accessing libcurl from perl)
<p>
 libcurl is a solid and reliable multi-protocol file transfer library for URL
 syntax defined files. We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within
 our Perl programs.

<p>
 All you need to do is to install the Curl::easy package and then you'll be
 able to use the Perl binding.

<p><b>How to Install</b></br>
 Install curl and libcurl first. Make sure you install the libcurl.so library
 and curl's include files as well. (E.g. if you are using an rpm version of
 curl, you will need to install the curl-devel rpm before you can build
 the Perl binding.)

<p>
 Run these commands:
 <pre>
   cd [curl::easy-directory]
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test # optional, needs a test server
   make install
</pre>
<p>The Makefile.PL uses <tt>curl-config</tt> and internal guesses to find curl.h, and 
to then create a version of Curl::easy which matches your installed libcurl version.</p>
<p>Read and edit Makefile.PL if your curl.h file cannot be found.</p>
<p><b>Binding documentation</b><br> The binding closely resembles the C
 one, so it should be OK to study the regular <a href="/libcurl/c/">libcurl
 C/C++ API docs</a> for most options.
<p>
Perl specific features are described in the <a href="easy.pm.html">Curl::easy POD documentation</a>.
<p><b>Examples</b><br> Here's a first <a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/curl/perl/examples/basicfirst.pl?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">basic example</a>, please post your contributions!

<p>Additional examples can be found in the 't/' directory of the distribution - the perl
regression test scripts. These exercise many of curls' functions, such as uploads,
callbacks and ssl, so are a useful starting point.

<a href="Curl-easy-1.33.tar.gz">Curl::easy 1.33</a> (18Kb) was released on Aug 5, 2002. This fixes an important bug in read callbacks, introduced in 1.30, which resulted in junk data being sent if a perl read callback was used. <b>If you are using any 1.3x version of Curl::easy, it is recommended that you upgrade to this release.</b></p>
<p>1.3x is an 'all-new' release series of Curl::easy, with substantially re-factored internal code.
This release supports the 'Object Oriented' style of perl coding, which provides a simpler,
less cluttered syntax, and fixes a number of limitations and bugs in earlier versions (such
as the inability to reliably use more than one curl handle per process!).</p>
<p>Version 1.33 is backwards compatible with previous releases, so you
can keep using scripts with the older syntax, upgrading when you wish to benefit from
a cleaner programming style.</p>
<p>v1.33 should be considered the 'best' available version of Curl::easy, and should be used
for all versions of curl from 7.8 onwards. This release is well tested, but the actual
code is subtantially different from v1.21, so please report any problems. Feel free to
use 1.21 in the meantime if you discover any major showstopper.</p>
<p>There are a few new functions in this release over v1.21:<p>
<ul>
    <li>$curl-&gt;errbuf to return the errbuf in a more convenient (and handle/thread safe) way.
    <li>Curl::easy-&gt;new() as a (preferred) alias to Curl::easy::init.
    <li>Curl::easy::global_cleanup() to allow you to call this low level curl function if you need it.
    <li>Now uses PerlIO for file input/output, so should be perl 5.8 ready.
</ul>
<p>Curl::easy 1.32 (18Kb) was released on Aug 1, 2002. This fixed a minor build issue with curl-7.8 (as distributed with Redhat 7.2)</p>
<p>Curl::easy 1.31 (18Kb) was released on July 16, 2002. This fixed minor build issues with 1.30 on some platforms with strict C compilers.</p>
<p>Curl::easy 1.30 (18Kb) was released on July 15, 2002.</p>
<p>
<a href="Curl-easy-1.21.tar.gz">Curl::easy 1.21</a> (15Kb) was released on
July 11, 2002.</p>
<p>This release automatically adapts to the options in your libcurl version,
and should support versions from 7.8.1 onwards, including 7.9,7.9.2 thru 7.9.8</p>
<p>Version 1.21 integrates some minor build changes to assist in building on Win32,
after feedback from Shawn Poulson. There are no functional changes.</p>
<p>You should probably use v1.32 for any new development, unless you hit specific problems. Future
minor issues in 1.21 may be fixed by further 1.2x releases, but any new features will be developed
starting from v1.30.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Curl::easy 1.20 was released on February 16, 2002.</p>
<p>Version 1.20 addressed some minor build issues reported with 1.1.9.
The version numbering now follows the standard perl module numbering syntax,
the same as CPAN modules (major.minor). Support for CURLOPT_STDERR was added.
</p>
<p>Curl::easy 1.1.9 was released on January 18, 2002.</p>
<p>This release automatically adapts to the options in your libcurl version,
and supports versions from 7.8.1 onwards.
