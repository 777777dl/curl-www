TITLE(Curl::easy -- accessing libcurl from perl)
<p>
 libcurl is a solid and reliable multi-protocol file transfer library for URL
 syntax defined files. We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within
 our Perl programs.

<p>
 All you need to do is to install the Curl::easy package and then you'll be
 able to use the Perl binding.

<p><b>How to Install</b></br>
 Install curl and libcurl first. Make sure you install the libcurl.so library
 and curl's include files as well. (E.g. if you are using an rpm version of
 curl, you will need to install the curl-devel rpm before you can build
 the Perl binding.)

<p>
 Run these commands:
 <pre>
   cd [curl::easy-directory]
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
</pre>
<p>The Makefile.PL uses <tt>curl-config</tt> and internal guesses to find curl.h, and 
to then create a version of Curl::easy which matches your installed libcurl version.</p>
<p>Read and edit Makefile.PL if your curl.h file cannot be found.</p>
<p><b>Binding documentation</b><br> The binding closely resembles the C
 one, so it should be OK to study the regular <a href="/libcurl/c/">libcurl
 C/C++ API docs</a> for most options.
<p>
Perl specific features are described in the <a href="easy.pm.html">Curl::easy POD documentation</a>.
<p><b>Examples</b><br> Here's a first <a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/curl/perl/examples/basicfirst.pl?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">basic example</a>, please post your contributions!

<p>Additional examples can be found in the 't/' directory of the distribution - the perl regression test scripts. These excercise many of curls functions, such as uploads, callbacks and ssl, so are a useful starting point.

<p><b>Download</b><br>
 <a href="Curl-easy-1.20.tar.gz">Curl::easy 1.20</a> (15Kb) was released on
 February 16, 2002.</p>
<p>This release automatically adapts to the options in your libcurl version,
and should support versions from 7.8.1 onwards, including 7.9,7.9.2 thru 7.9.5pre.
</p>
<p>Version 1.20 addresses some minor build issues reported with 1.1.9.
The version numbering now follows the standard perl module numbering syntax,
the same as CPAN modules (major.minor). Support for CURLOPT_STDERR was added.
</p>
 <p>Curl::easy 1.1.9 (18Kb) was released on January 18, 2002.</p>
<p>This release automatically adapted to the options in your libcurl version,
and supports versions from 7.8.1 onwards. Because of minor build issues, use 1.20 instead.
</p>
<p>
You should upgrade from 1.1.8 if you need access to options in libcurl versions
after 7.9.
</p>
 <a href="Curl-easy-1.1.8.tar.gz">Curl::easy 1.1.8</a> (14Kb) was released on
 September 20, 2001.</p>
<p>This release includes support for libcurl options in libcurl 7.9, though it
   can also be rebuilt for earlier libcurl versions. Better test scripts are also
   included.
<p>
   There is no need to upgrade from 1.1.6 or 1.1.7 unless you want access to new
   options in libcurl 7.9, such as SSL certificate name checking.
<p>
 <a href="Curl-easy-1.1.7.tar.gz">Curl::easy 1.1.7</a> (12Kb) was released on
 September 13, 2001.
<p>
 If you are using curl 7.8.1 or later, you will need to be using at least
 version 1.1.6 of Curl::easy.
<p>
 1.1.7 is a documentation only update, with more explicit licence information.
 There is no need to upgrade if you are already using 1.1.6.
<p>
