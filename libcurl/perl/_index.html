TITLE(Curl::easy -- accessing libcurl from perl)
<p>
 libcurl is a solid and reliable multi-protocol file transfer library for URL
 syntax defined files. We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within
 our Perl programs.

<p>
 All you need to do is to install the Curl::easy package and then you'll be
 able to use the Perl interface.

<p><b>How to Install</b></br>
 Install curl and libcurl first. Make sure you install the libcurl.so library
 and curl's include files as well. (E.g. if you are using an rpm version of
 curl, you will need to install the curl-devel rpm before you can build
 the Perl interface.)

<p>
 Run these commands:
 <pre>
   cd [curl::easy-directory]
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
</pre>
<p><b>Examples</b><br> Here's a first <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/perl/Curl_easy/examples/basicfirst.pl">basic
 example</a>, please post your contributions!

<p><b>Interface documentation</b><br> The interface closely resembles the C
 one, so it should be OK to study the regular <a href="/libcurl/c/">libcurl
 C/C++ API docs</a>.

<p><b>Download</b><br>
 <a href="Curl-easy-1.1.8.tar.gz">Curl::easy 1.1.8</a> (14Kb) was released on
 September 20, 2001.</p>
<p>This release includes support for libcurl options in libcurl 7.9, though it
   can also be rebuilt for earlier libcurl versions. Better test scripts are also
   included.
<p>
   There is no need to upgrade from 1.1.6 or 1.1.7 unless you want access to new
   options in libcurl 7.9, such as SSL certificate name checking.
<p>
 <a href="Curl-easy-1.1.7.tar.gz">Curl::easy 1.1.7</a> (12Kb) was released on
 September 13, 2001.
<p>
 If you are using curl 7.8.1 or later, you will need to be using at least
 version 1.1.6 of Curl-easy.
<p>
 1.1.7 is a documentation only update, with more explicit licence information.
 There is no need to upgrade if you are already using 1.1.6.
<p>
 See <a href="/lxr/source/perl/Curl_easy/Changes">Changes</a> for complete
 change information.
<p>
 For curl versions before 7.7, download the Perl interface version 1.0.2 from
 <a

 Browse the <a href="/lxr/source/perl/Curl_easy/">/perl/Curl_easy/</a> files
 that are presently in CVS.
