TITLE(Curl::easy -- accessing libcurl from perl)
<p>
 libcurl is a solid and reliable multi-protocol file transfer library for URL
 syntax defined files. We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within
 our Perl programs.

<p>
 All you need to do is to install the Curl::easy package and then you'll be
 able to use the Perl interface.

<p><b>How to Install</b></br>
 Install curl and libcurl first. Make sure you install the libcurl.so library
 and curl's include files as well. (E.g. if you are using an rpm version of
 curl, you will need to install the curl-devel rpm before you can build
 the Perl interface.

<p>
 Run these commands:
 <pre>
   cd [curl::easy-directory]
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
</pre>
<p><b>Examples</b><br> Please post any examples you've made, as I have none!

<p><b>Interface documentation</b><br> The interface closely resembles the C
 one, so it should be OK to study the regular <a href="/libcurl/c/">libcurl
 C/C++ API docs</a>.

<p><b>Download</b><br>

 The Curl::easy interface is part of the full source code release archive from
 version 7.7 and onwards. It is however also released separately and thus
 there may be a newer perl interface.
<p>
 <a href="Curl-easy-1.1.7.tar.gz">Curl::easy 1.1.7</a> (12Kb) was released on
 September 13, 2001.
<p>
 If you are using curl 7.8.1 or later, you will need to be using at least
 version 1.1.6 of Curl-easy.
<p>
 1.1.7 is a documentation only update, with more explicit licence information.
 There is no need to upgrade if you are already using 1.1.6.
<p>
 See <a href="/lxr/source/perl/Curl_easy/Changes">Changes</a> for complete
 change information.
<p>
 For curl versions before 7.7, download Perl interface version 1.0.2
 from
 <a href="http://www.koblenz-net.de/~horn/export/">www.koblenz-net.de/~horn/export/</a>
<p>
 Browse the <a href="/lxr/source/perl/Curl_easy/">/perl/Curl_easy/</a> files
 that are presently in CVS.

<p><b>Credits</b><br>
 The Perl interface was initially written by Georg Horn and is currently 
 maintained by Cris Bailiff.
