TITLE(Curl::easy -- accessing libcurl from perl)
<p>
 libcurl is a solid and reliable multi-protocol file transfer library for URL
 syntax defined files. We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within
 our Perl programs.

<p>
 All you need to do is to install the Curl::easy package and then you'll be
 able to use the Perl binding.

<p><b>How to Install</b></br>
 Install curl and libcurl first. Make sure you install the libcurl.so library
 and curl's include files as well. (E.g. if you are using an rpm version of
 curl, you will need to install the curl-devel rpm before you can build
 the Perl binding.)

<p>
 Run these commands:
 <pre>
   cd [curl::easy-directory]
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
</pre>
<p>The Makefile.PL uses <tt>curl-config</tt> and internal guesses to find curl.h, and 
to then create a version of Curl::easy which matches your installed libcurl version.</p>
<p>Read and edit Makefile.PL if your curl.h file cannot be found.</p>
<p><b>Binding documentation</b><br> The binding closely resembles the C
 one, so it should be OK to study the regular <a href="/libcurl/c/">libcurl
 C/C++ API docs</a> for most options.
<p>
Perl specific features are described in the <a href="easy.pm.html">Curl::easy POD documentation</a>.
<p><b>Examples</b><br> Here's a first <a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/curl/perl/examples/basicfirst.pl?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">basic example</a>, please post your contributions!

<p>Additional examples can be found in the 't/' directory of the distribution - the perl
regression test scripts. These excercise many of curls' functions, such as uploads,
callbacks and ssl, so are a useful starting point.
</p>

<p><b>Download</b><br>

and should support versions from 7.8.1 onwards, including 7.9,7.9.2 thru 7.9.8</p>
<p>Version 1.21 integrates some minor build changes to assist in building on Win32,
after feedback from Shawn Poulson. There are no functional changes</p>
<p>This is the 'best' available version of Curl::easy, and should be used

<p>Curl::easy 1.20 was released on February 16, 2002.</p>
<p>Version 1.20 addressed some minor build issues reported with 1.1.9.
The version numbering now follows the standard perl module numbering syntax,
the same as CPAN modules (major.minor). Support for CURLOPT_STDERR was added.
