TITLE(Curl::easy -- accessing libcurl from perl)
<p>
 libcurl is a solid and reliable multi-protocol file transfer library for URL
 syntax defined files. We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within
 our Perl programs.

<p>
 All you need to do is to install the Curl::easy package and then you'll be
 able to use the Perl interface.

<p><b>How to Install</b></br>
 Install curl and libcurl first. Make sure you install the libcurl.so library
 and curl's include files as well.

<p>
 Run these commands:
 <pre>
   cd [curl::easy-directory]
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
</pre>
<p><b>Examples</b><br> Please post any examples you've made, as I have none!

<p><b>Interface documentation</b><br> The interface closely resembles the C
 one, so it should be OK to study the regular <a href="/libcurl/c/">libcurl
 C/C++ API docs</a>.

<p><b>Download</b><br>

 The Curl::easy interface is part of the full source code release archive from
 version 7.7 and onwards. It is however also released separately and thus
 there may be a newer perl interface. Check out <a
 href="http://www.koblenz-net.de/~horn/export/">www.koblenz-net.de/~horn/export/</a>
 for the latest packages.
<p>
 <a href="Curl-easy-1.1.5.tar.gz">curl::easy 1.1.5</a> (12Kb) was uploaded on
 April 20, 2001.
<p>
 For curl versions before 7.7, download <a href="Curl_easy-1.0.2.tgz">Perl
 interface version 1.0.2</a>
<p>
 Browse the <a href="/lxr/source/perl/Curl_easy/">/perl/Curl_easy/</a> files
 that are presently in CVS.
