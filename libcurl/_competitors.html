<p>
Free Software and Open Source projects have a long tradition of forks and
duplicate efforts. We enjoy "doing it ourselves", no matter if someone else
has done something very similar already.

<p>
These are free/open libraries that cover parts of what libcurl features (some
of them also do a lot more than libcurl):

<p>
<b><a href="./">libcurl</a></b> (MIT)<br>
<ul>
  a highly portable and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library,
  supporting FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, GOPHER, TELNET, DICT, FILE and LDAP.
  libcurl also supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP
  uploading, kerberos, HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password
  authentication, file transfer resume, http proxy tunneling and more!
</ul>

<p>
<b>libghttp</b> (LGPL)<br>
<ul>
  Having a glance at libghttp (a gnome http library), it looks as if it works
  rather similar to libcurl (for http). There's no web page for this and the
  person who's email is mentioned in the README of the latest release I found
  claims he has passed the leadership of the project to "eazel". Popular
  choice among GNOME projects.
</ul>
<b><a href="http://www.w3.org/Library/">libwww</a></b> (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231">W3C license</a>)<br>
<ul>
  Much more complex, bloated and potent than libcurl is. Includes everything
  from multi-threading to HTML parsing. Most notable features that libcurl
  does not offer are cashing and HTTP pipelining.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.westga.edu/~stu7440/projects/ferit.html">libferit</a></b> (GPL)<br>
<ul>
  C++ library "for transferring files via http, ftp, gopher, proxy server".
  Based on 'snarf' 2.0.9-code (formerly known as libsnarf).  Quote from
  freshmeat: <i>"As the author of snarf, I have to say this frightens
  me. Snarf's networking system is far from robust and complete. It's probably
  full of bugs, and although it works for maybe 85% of all current situations,
  I wouldn't base a library on it."</i>

</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.webdav.org/neon/">neon</a></b> (LGPL)<br>
<ul>
  An HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C interface. I've mainly heard
  and seen people use this with WebDAV as their main interest.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/soup/README">libsoup</a></b> (LGPL)<br>
<ul>
 Part of glib (GNOME). Supports: HTTP 1.1, Persistent connections, Asyncronous
 DNS and transfers, Connection cache, Redirects, Basic, Digest, NTLM
 authentication, SSL with OpenSSL or Mozilla NSS, Proxy support including SSL,
 SOCKS support, POST data. Probably not very portable.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/">mozilla netlib</a></b> (MPL)<br>
<ul>
  Handles URLs, protocols, transports for the Mozilla browser. 
</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpnet/">mozilla libxpnet</a></b> (MPL)<br>
<ul> Minimal download library targeted to be much smaller than the above
  mentioned netlib. HTTP and FTP support.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://wget.sunsite.dk/">wget</a></b> (GPL)<br>
<ul>
  While not a library at all, I've been told that people sometimes extract the
  network code from it and base their own hacks from there.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/lib/libfetch/">libfetch</a></b> (BSD)<br>
<ul>
 Does HTTP and FTP transfers (both ways), supports file: URLs, and an API for
 URL parsing. The utility <i>fetch</i> that is built on libfetch is an
 integral part of the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> operating
 system.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://http-fetcher.sourceforge.net/">HTTP Fetcher</a></b>
(LGPL)<br> <ul> "<i>a small, robust, flexible library for downloading files
via HTTP using the GET method.</i>" </ul>

<b><a href="http://www.demailly.com/~dl/wwwtools.html#http-tiny">http-tiny</a></b> (Artistic License)<br>
<ul>
"<i>a very small C library to make http queries (GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, etc.) easily portable and embeddable</i>"
</ul>

<b><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/xmlsdk30/htm/xmobjxmlhttprequest.asp">XMLHTTP Object</a></b> also known as IXMLHTTPRequest (part of MSXML 3.0)<br>
<ul>
 (Windows) Provides client-side protocol support for communication with HTTP
 servers. A client computer can use the XMLHTTP object to send an arbitrary
 HTTP request, receive the response, and have the Microsoft® XML Document
 Object Model (DOM) parse that response.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/3.0/qhttp.html">QHttp</a></b> (GPL)<br>
<ul>
 QHttp is a class in the Qt library from Troll Tech.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://nbpfaus.net/~pfau/ftplib/">ftplib</a></b> (GPL)
<ul>
 "<i>a set of routines that implement the FTP protocol. They allow
 applications to create and access remote files through function calls instead
 of needing to fork and exec an interactive ftp client program."</i>
</ul>

 Is there any programmer(s) in the audience that have tried programming with
the other libs and care share their experiences? I'd love to make this
collecion more complete and feature lenghtier comments about each lib.
