 <i>The <a href="http://dev.bluesecurity.com/">Blue Frog</a> application uses
 a libcurl based HTTP client engine (with Zlib and OpenSSL), that is
 scriptable through Lua scripts using an internally developed glue
 library. Libcurl proved to be a solid solution with excellent support and a
 lively community of developers. The high level interface is feature rich,
 easy to use and well documented (!). During our debugging sessions we noticed
 that code is well written and is open for enhancements. Definitely a safe bet
 when it comes to HTTP client libraries.</i> - Shmulik Regev
