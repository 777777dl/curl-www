<li> <i>The <a href="http://dev.bluesecurity.com/">Blue Frog</a> application
 uses a libcurl based HTTP client engine (with Zlib and OpenSSL), that is
 scriptable through Lua scripts using an internally developed glue
 library. Libcurl proved to be a solid solution with excellent support and a
 lively community of developers. The high level interface is feature rich,
 easy to use and well documented (!). During our debugging sessions we noticed
 that code is well written and is open for enhancements. Definitely a safe bet
 when it comes to HTTP client libraries.</i> - Shmulik Regev

<li> <i><a href="http://www.unrealircd.com/">UnrealIRCd</a> makes use of
 libcurl to allow chat network administrators to store their configurations in
 a central location and retrieve them securely using both HTTPS and FTPS
 protocols. Libcurl made the integration of this feature fast and easy by
 allowing minimal changes to the internal structure of our code. Libcurl has
 also been beneficial to us since it is under constant development and the
 developers are most certainly open to suggestions from us, as well as
 others. We look forward to seeing where libcurl will go in the future, and to
 finding new ways to make use of libcurl!</i> - Dominick "codemastr" Meglio
