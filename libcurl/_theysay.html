 This is what some developers have said about libcurl.
<p>
<ul>

<li> <i>I am using libcurl as the backend of my news notification program
which provides popups of new news via rss feeds. I have to say libcurl has
been the easiest thing to use that I've seen, and I will continue to use it in
later versions of my applications. Kudos to the developers!</i> - Don Neumann
<a href="http://www.quietearth.us/newsnotification.htm">News notification</a>

<li> <i>We have found libcurl to be an important cornerstone in many of our
 applications, which need to run on a variety of platforms. Its solid
 reliability, simple API, and excellent mailing list support made it an easy
 choice for us.</i> - Jonathan Arnold <a
 href="http://www.insors.com/">inSORS</a>

<li> <i>libcurl allows us to build next generation Internet applications
 without worrying about the Internet.  libcurl elegantly and reliable handles
 all of our uploading and downloading so we can worry about creating great new
 software.</i> - Matt Veenstra <a href="http://www.tribalmedia.com/">tribalmedia</a>

<li> <i>The <a href="http://dev.bluesecurity.com/">Blue Frog</a> application
 uses a libcurl based HTTP client engine (with Zlib and OpenSSL), that is
 scriptable through Lua scripts using an internally developed glue
 library. Libcurl proved to be a solid solution with excellent support and a
 lively community of developers. The high level interface is feature rich,
 easy to use and well documented (!). During our debugging sessions we noticed
 that code is well written and is open for enhancements. Definitely a safe bet
 when it comes to HTTP client libraries.</i> - Shmulik Regev

<li> <i><a href="http://www.unrealircd.com/">UnrealIRCd</a> makes use of
 libcurl to allow chat network administrators to store their configurations in
 a central location and retrieve them securely using both HTTPS and FTPS
 protocols. Libcurl made the integration of this feature fast and easy by
 allowing minimal changes to the internal structure of our code. Libcurl has
 also been beneficial to us since it is under constant development and the
 developers are most certainly open to suggestions from us, as well as
 others. We look forward to seeing where libcurl will go in the future, and to
 finding new ways to make use of libcurl!</i> - Dominick "codemastr" Meglio

<li> <i> Making use of libcurl its easily possible to integrate web services
 like ebay (please see ebay codebase) or google .. into your client
 programs for your desktop. It also fits fine within the platform
 independent programming Qt Toolkit made by Trolltech AS.</i>
 - Roland Mundloch, near Munich Germany.

<li> <i> <a href="http://www.focuseek.com/">focuseek searchbox</a> takes
advantage of cURL to crawl HTTP, HTTPS and FTP sites both on intranets and on
the internet. cURL is really solid and stable, provides a multithreaded api
and is compatible with the many quirks of servers &quot;as seen in the
wild&quot;. Moreover it supports a lot of platforms, is really easy to use and,
last but not least, its developers are competent and willing to help.</i>
 - Michele Bini, Florence, Italy

<li> <i>Thanks a lot for a <u>very</u> useful library!  (soooo much more
stable and powerful than widely used alternatives, it's not even funny! Helped
me tremendously in getting net transfers just right)</i> - <a
