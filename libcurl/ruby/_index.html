TITLE(accessing libcurl from Ruby)

<p>
 libcurl is a solid and reliable multi-protocol file transfer library for URL
 syntax defined files. We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within
 our Ruby programs.

<p>
 All you need to do is to install the Ruby/libcurl package and then you'll be
 able to use it.
