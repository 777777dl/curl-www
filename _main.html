  Curl is free and <a href="docs/copyright.html">open software</a> that
  compiles under a wide variety of operating systems. Curl exists thanks to
  efforts from <a href="docs/thanks.html">many authors</a>, with <a
  href="http://daniel.haxx.se/">Daniel Stenberg</a> being primary author and
  project maintainer. Curl is the result of many spare time hours of
  programming. Voluntary contributions are vital.  We greatly appreciate <a
  href="help.html">your help</a>!
<p>
  <b>The most recent stable version of curl is version __STABLE</b>, released
  on __RELDATE.  There are currently __CURR available archives of the <a
  href="download.html">latest curl package</a>.
<p>
  Curl comes bundled with many <a href="docs/osdistribs.html">Operating
  Systems</a>. You may already have it installed!
<p>
  Use the cURL <a href="/docs/manpage.html">command line tool</a> or use <a
  href="libcurl/">libcurl</a> from within your own programs, report bugs on
  the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=976">curl bug
  tracker</a>, post questions to one of the <a href="mail/">mailing lists</a>,
