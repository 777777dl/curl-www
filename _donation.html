 DONATE
<p>
 If you use curl a lot and like it, why not support the project with a little
 donation?
<p>
 If your company makes money from curl or curl-related services, why not
 support the project that feeds you?

DONATE

<p>
 Donations made to this paypal account go to Daniel Stenberg, head of the curl
 project and main author. Daniel will keep track of the money and spend them
 on curl-related activities.
<p>
 If this works out, more details and reports will follow. If no one donates
 anything, well then no one will care anyway.
