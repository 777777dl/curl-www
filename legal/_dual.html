TITLE(New Licensing and Old Problems)

 This text contains opinions, they are mine (Daniel's). It also contains
facts, those I believe are true no matter what my opinions are.
<p>
 <i>I am not a license expert and nor am I a lawyer. Feel free to object
  to anything I might say that seems wrong.</i>

<p> <b>How did everything start?</b>
<ul>
<li>
  I licensed curl under MPL once upon the time since that license appealed the
  most to me at the time of chosing. I did not consider "GPL compatibility"
  back then and I wasn't even aware of such problems until years later.
  (Possibly because it took years before any GPL-programs wanted to use it!
  ;-)
<p>
  I was young and possibly also naive.
<p>
  MPL is what a GNU person would call "weak copyleft". Copyleft (explained to
  someone not very much into this kind of stuff) in the sense that it forces
  anyone doing changes to the sources to make the changes public when the
  changed program is distributed.
<p>
  GPL requires that all parts of a distributed program is "compatible" with
  it, and they say MPL isn't compatible. GPL is "strong copyleft" in that
  sense, it spreads and make demands on other parts of a program that uses a
  single GPLed part. MPL doesn't.
<p>
  GPL people says that is good since it helps making the entire program free
  and keeping it so.  I think its bad since I don't want my project to impose
  regulations on other parts of an application.
<p>
  <i>I want to be able to use curl and libcurl in closed-source projects.</i>

<p>
<li> Curl has truely been a work of many contributors. I have gathered the
  names of the people that have done "non-trivial" improvements in the bottom
  of the man page, and it currently lists 54 names as of this writing. (More
  may have been added by the time you read this.)
<p>
  To change the license completely, I need the permission of all authors or I
  need to rewrite the parts I don't get permission for. I can't change license
  as I please.
<p>
  MPL allows me to sublicense the work, and thus I dual-license curl using a
  different license at the same time while offering it as MPL. This will allow
  me to continue business as usual while moving towards a fully converted
  license.

<p>
<li> LGPL you might say, as a general answer to plain-GPL doubts. LGPL doesn't
  spread to other parts of an application and it does allow being linked with
  closed-source programs. LGPL is "compatible" with GPL in the sense that you
  can, at your option, convert a LGPLed program to a GPLed one any time you
  want (LGPL license paragraph three). Such a change is irreversible. This is
  what I like to call GPL-hijacking. For a small project, this is a risk. If a
  truly skilled person adds a lot of functionality to a LGPLed project and
  relicenses it and his/hers changes to GPL, the previous LGPLed version would
  swiftly be abandoned and the GPL-changes cannot be applied back in the LGPL
  version. Or, you'd fork and the LGPL-version would have to be kept aside of
  the GPL version.
<p>
  LGPL also forces closed-source programs that uses LGPL libs to release their
  object files (or similarly) so that anyone can relink the package with newer
  versions of the LGPLed library should that become available (LGPL license
  paragraph six). This won't even be considered by many closed-source
  projects, and thus a LGPL library won't be used in them.

<p>
<li>
  Where lies this GPL vs MPL license problem? MPL itself has no problems with
  the LGPL or GPL licenses, the problem is on the GNU side. GPL has a problem
  with MPL.

</ul>
<p>
  <b>Then what am I gonna do?</b>
<ul>
<li>
  I've constructed the new curl license. It is based on the extremely liberal
  MIT/X-license (a BSD derivate without the announce clause). It basically
  allows anyone to do anything with the sources as long as the copyright text
  in them are left intact. There's no copyleft at all involved and there's
  this risk people will grab all the sources, make private changes and release
  closed-source projects using this. I'm willing to take that risk. The
  license is deemed <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#TOCGPLCompatibleLicenses">"GPL
  compatible"</a> by the FSF priests.
<p>
  Since I can dual-license curl without the consent of all the authors, this
  has now been introduced. I don't want to make unnecessary mistakes. I will
  thus also continue offering curl/libcurl as MPL to hold on to the commitment
  people have contributed code to in the past.
<p>
  I've updated the source headers and most texts in the release archive. I'll
  continue to work on all texts in the archive and on web site to make them
  up-to-date with this.

</ul>
<p><b>Will this do?</b>
<ul>
<li> This makes curl/libcurl compatible with all known free software
  licenses. Including GPL, LGPL and MPL.

<p>
<li>
  As time passes, I intend to phase out the MPL completely.

</ul>

<p>
  The two licenses involved, in plain text versions:
<ul>
 <li> <a href="MPL-1.1.txt">MPL 1.1</a>
 <li> <a href="LEGAL.MITX">MIT/X-derivate</a>
</ul>
