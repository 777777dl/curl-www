<p>
 We get repeated questions about the legal status of <a
 href="thename.html">the name curl</a>. Who owns it, can we use it, will
 someone sue us?
<p>
 This section also contains the <a href="licmix.html">Licence Mixing</a>
 document since curl/libcurl can be built and used with quite a few
 dependences and this document tries to sort out some of the license issues
 involved.
