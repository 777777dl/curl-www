TITLE(How Why And Where To Report Bugs)
<p>
 Of course there are bugs in curl. Some are known, but most of them remain
 unknown to us until you let us know. We depend on bug reports from the users
 that find the problems. We are not likely to be able to fix bugs if we don't
 get to know about their existance first. Bugs tend to get fixed within a
 short while after we've been notified (at least when we agree about it being
 a bug and not a feature)!

<ul>
<p><b> If you can't fix a bug yourself and submit a fix for it, file an <i>as
 detailed report as possible</i> in the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=976">curl's bug tracking
 system</a></b> or possibly mail it to curl-bug_at_haxx.se.
</ul>
<p>
 If you have an idea of what to add to curl or what to change in curl that
 isn't actually a bug, post that to the <a href="/feedback/">feedback
 forum</a>.

<P>
 When reporting a bug, try to include information that will help us understand
 what's wrong, what's expected to happen and how to repeat it. You therefore
 need to supply:
 <ul>
 <li> your operating system's name and version number (uname -a
 under a unix is fine)
 <li> what version of curl you're using (curl -V is fine)
 <li> what URL you were working with
 <li> anything else you think matters.
 </ul>

<p>
 Learn more about what to include in a bug report and how to get a stack trace
 by reading the <a href="/docs/bugs.html">Bugs</a> document.

TITLE(cURL Module Bugs in PHP)
<p>
 If you experience problems with the curl module in PHP, that doesn't seem to
 happen with libcurl or curl in other situations, file the report in the <a
 href="http://bugs.php.net/">PHP bug tracker</a>. Make it of type 'cURL
 related'.
<p>
 We do have a cooperation with the PHP development team to make sure no
 problems 'fall through'.
