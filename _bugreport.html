TITLEPRE How, Why, And Where to Report Bugs
TITLEPOST
<p>
 Of course there are bugs in curl and libcurl. Some are known, but most of
 them remain unknown to us until you let us know. We depend on bug reports
 from the users to find the problems. We are not likely to be able to fix bugs
 if we don't get to know about their existance first. Bugs tend to get fixed
 within a short while after we've been notified (at least when we agree about
 it being a bug and not a feature)!

SUBTITLE(Known Bugs)
<p>
 Some bugs are known to already exist. We try to keep track of them on a
 separate <a href="/docs/knownbugs.html">KNOWN_BUGS</a> document.

SUBTITLE(How To Report)
<ul>
<p> If you can't fix a bug yourself, file an <i>as detailed a report as
 possible</i> in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=976">bug
 tracking system</a> or mail it to a suitable <a href="/mail/">mailing
 list</a>.
</ul>

<p>
 If you have an idea for something to add to curl or something to change in
 curl that isn't actually a bug, post that on the <a
 href="/feedback/">feedback forum</a> or to a <a href="/mail/">mailing
 list</a>.

<P>
 When reporting a bug, try to include information that will help us understand
 what's wrong, what's expected to happen and how to repeat it. You therefore
 need to supply:

<ul>
 <li> your operating system's name and version number (uname -a
 under a unix is fine)
 <li> what version of curl you're using (curl -V is fine)
 <li> what URL you were working with
 <li> anything else you think might matter.
</ul>

<p>
 Learn more about what to include in a bug report and how to get a stack trace
 by reading the <a href="/docs/bugs.html">BUGS</a> document.

TITLE(Bugs in libcurl bindings)
<p>
 There will of course pop up bugs in libcurl bindings. Try to report those
 bugs in the correct forum. Here's a collection of links and advice for you!

SUBTITLE(PHP/CURL)
<p>
 If you experience problems with the curl module in PHP, and they don't seem
 to happen with libcurl or curl in other situations, please file the report in
 the <a href="http://bugs.php.net/">PHP bug tracker</a>. Make sure it's marked
 as 'cURL related'.
