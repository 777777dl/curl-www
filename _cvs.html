  To simply browse the <a href="http://cvs.php.net/cvs.php/curl">CVS
  Repository</a> or the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/">LXR-indexed
  sources</a>, just click a link.

TITLE(<b>Get</b> the Sources)
<p>
  The curl sources are kept in a CVS repository. You can get the most recent
  curl source files from there at any time. CVS is the version control system
  we use for the curl project. All files in the release archive that aren't
  generated from other files are kept there, to allow full backtracking of
  older versions. To use CVS you need a CVS client, get yours from <a
  href="http://www.cvshome.org/">www.cvshome.org</a>.  Windows users might
  fancy <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">TortoiseCVS</a> or <a
  href="http://www.wincvs.org/">WinCvs</a>.
<p>
  This is mostly a feature for you who really want to have a peek in how the
  current development version looks like, and not if you just want to download
  a version to run. If you just want to download a tar or binary archive, <a
  href="download.html">go here</a>.
<p>
  If you want to use the CVS server, login:
<pre>
  cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository login
</pre>
<p>
  You will be prompted for the password, then you enter <b>phpfi</b>. When
  logged in, checkout all the files in the curl respository:
<pre>
  cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout curl
</pre>
<p>
  <b>Note</b> that this will create a curl subdirectory.
<p>
  If you at a later time want to get the updated set of files, just cd into
  this directory and run this command (there's no need for the -d then):
<pre>
  cvs update
</pre>
<p>
  If a proxy, firewall or something else is preventing you from using CVS to
  get the latest sources, consider a <a
  href="http://cool.haxx.se/curl-daily/"> daily build</a>.

TITLE(<b>Compile and Build</b> the Sources)
<p>
 When you checkout the sources, you get a file named CVS-INFO in the source
 root that describes how to proceed to compile and build them.

TITLE(<b>Change</b> the Sources)
<p>
 If you are about to do a lot of modifications, discuss it on the curl or
 libcurl mailing list in advance and we might give you write permission
 straight into the CVS!

<p>
 The CVS repository is hosted by <a href="http://www.php.net/">php.net</a>.
