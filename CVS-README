You read this because you got all these web pages from the curl CVS repository.

Have a look at this web page for some editing guidelines:

        http://curl.haxx.se/web-editing.html

To build actual HTML pages from these source files, you will most likely need
the following tools:

o 'cpp'        Daniel's cpp preprocessor with web extensions
o 'man2html'   A man page to HTML converter
o 'txt2html'   A plain text to HTML converter
o 'txt2plain'  Daniel's very simple perl script to convert < and > etc to HTML
o 'gnudate'    The GNU date command

Run 'make' in the www-root to build the full site. Requires GNU make.

Add a symbolic link named 'cvssource' in the web site's root dir to point to
the root of a curl source tree (have that automatically updated from CVS to be
really good). Many docs pages are generated from the docs files of that source
tree.

You must have .shtml running on your server, you must have perl in
/usr/bin/perl.

There are probably a thousand more things to say, but this is a start! ;-)
