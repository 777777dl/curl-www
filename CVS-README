You read this because you got all these web pages from the curl CVS repository.

To build actual HTML pages from these source files, you will most likely need
the following tools:

o 'cpp'        Daniel's cpp preprocessor with web extensions
o 'man2html'   A man page to HTML converter
o 'txt2html'   A plain text to HTML converter
o 'txt2plain'  Daniel's very simple perl script to convert < and > etc to HTML

Run 'make' in the www-root to build the full site.

You must have .shtml running on your server, you must have perl in
/usr/bin/perl.

There are probably a thousand more things to say, but this is a start! ;-)
