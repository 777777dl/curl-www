You read this because you got all these web pages from the curl CVS repository.

Have a look at this web page for some editing guidelines:

        http://curl.haxx.se/web-editing.html

To build actual good-looking HTML pages from these source files, you will need
the following tools:

o 'cpp'        Daniel's cpp preprocessor with web extensions
o 'man2html'   A man page to HTML converter
o 'txt2html'   A plain text to HTML converter
o 'txt2plain.pl' Very simple perl script to convert < and > etc to HTML
o 'gnudate'    The GNU date command (could be symbolicly linked to /bin/data
               on a Linux system)
o 'gnroff'     The GNU nroff (could be symbolicly linked to /usr/bin/nroff on
               a Linux system)

Add a symbolic link named 'cvssource' in the web site's root dir to point to
the root of a curl source tree (have that automatically updated from CVS to be
really good). Many web site pages are generated from the docs files in the
source tree.

Run 'make' in the www-root to build the full site. Requires GNU make.

You must have .shtml (SSI, server side includes) running on your server, you
must have perl in /usr/bin/perl.

There are probably a thousand more things to say, but this is a start! ;-)
