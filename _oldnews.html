 NSUBJ(More betas)
 NDATE(14 June 2000 afternoon)
 NCOLS 

  I uploaded the 7.0.5beta about the same time I added a search field in the
  footer of every web page on the site. Studying how people end up on this
  site, it shows that an awful lot of people pop in on an odd page using a
  search engine, and since that page isn't always 100% on focus with what the
  person was after I think I can decrease some amount of problems by offering
  a site search field straight away! Hopefully this is the last beta before I
  release version 7 for real!

 NDATE(8 June 2000)
 NCOLS 

  If you have any reports on the version seven beta-series, please bring them

  will be gone for four weeks, starting at June 24th, and I really would like
  to get the version seven out well before that so I get some time to smoothen
  out any possible problems and update the web pages with up-to-date ports etc

  Jörn has patiently been working with the win32 ports of curl as well as the

 NSUBJ(TLD hopping)
 NDATE(6 June 2000)
 NCOLS 

  <a href="http://curl.haxx.se">curl.haxx.se</a> is the new curl site since <a
  href="http://www.haxx.se">Haxx</a> changed TLD just now. The old haxx.nu
  domain will probably hang around another year or so. I'll add a redirect as
  well so that the transfer will probably hardly be noticable for most people.

 NSUBJ(Debian joins the growing list)

 NSUBJ(more libcurl docs appearing)
 NDATE(2 June 2000)
 NCOLS 
  
  The <a href="/libcurl/docs/">libcurl docs</a> page has been updated with
  detailed descriptions of six more libcurl functions. Now, all the functions
  used by the curl application are documented (hm, ok, curl_formparse() isn't

 NSUBJ(Beta-Mania Season)
 NDATE(31 May 2000)
 NCOLS 
  
  <a href="/beta/">Version 7.0.3beta</a> arrived just a bunch of hours after
  the 7.0.2 just because I discovered the 7.0.2 doesn't compile on Linux
  systems due to incompatible gethostbyname_r() calls in Solaris (and others,
  like IRIX) and Linux (any other?). Only some 6 or 7 people downloaded the
  previous version.

 NSUBJ(Another Beta Version is Out)
 NDATE(30 May 2000)

 NSUBJ(email addresses slightly remodeled)
 NDATE(25 May 2000)
 NCOLS 

  On request from several people, I hacked in an option to hypermail that now
  allows it to mangle email addresses slightly in ordere to make them less
  attractive to those spammers' email-collecting robots. The mailing list <a

 NSUBJ(libcurl docs in the pipe)

 NDATE(22 May 2000)
 NCOLS
  
  To give you a taste of the new names in libcurl, I felt I should upload a <a

  now, why I won't always bother to make noise about every single new release.

  Jörn Hartroth brought me a win32-binary of that beta that I also put on the

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(FTP)
 NDATE(10 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  FTP style URLs. The directory part of FTP URLs were not treated
  properly. Now I make sure to URL-decode <i>after</i> I've separated the path
  into directory and file name. I've also changed the way curl performs now,
  in that it will now make a CWD to the specified directory and there it will
  make the operation on the file. This also has the benefit that ftp upload
  will work better on the funet FTP server (I mean the actual software, not
  that particular site).

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(let it become libcurl 7!)
 NDATE(27 Apr 2000)

  I didn't come up with any ideas nor did anyone else present any that made my
  hair rise. So, as some pointed out, instead we go with the somewhat familiar
  name 'libcurl' and just call the new design version 7. There has been some
  discussions about it and you can now see parts of it in the CVS.

 NSUBJ(CVS branch newlib)

  <I>The Written Word</i> now has all those unix binaries up-to-date as well,
  over at the <a href="download.html">download page</a>. They added HPUX 11 to
  the collection too.

  - <a href="mailto:tom.hurst@clara.net">Thomas Hurst</a> mailed me to inform
  that he has compiled curl for the <b>Amiga</b> without problems. I've added
  that to the <a href="download.html">download</a> page. <br>

  - Just for fun I grepped the last month's log files. It seems curl packages
  have been downloaded 6765 times from this web server the last month only. It
  also showed that hardly anyone uses the ftp-download opportunity from this
  site...

  <a href="mailto:tengel@sonic.net">Troy Engel</a> passed the Redhat RPMs as

  Several improvements and a few rather serious bugs have been corrected, as
  described in the <a href="changes.html">changes</a> page. Prepare for a new
  release within short.

  Added the Install page here too. It is just the packaged INSTALL file
  converted to HTML. I get a lot of questions regarding these matters, so
  maybe, just maybe, it'll be a bit more accessible if I put the info here
  too! ;-)

  Lots of 6.1-packages available now. Troy and The Written Word were really
  fast with these!

  <a href="download.html">Curl 6.1 is here</a>. There's not that many <a
  href="changes.html">changes</a> from the 6.1beta, but this is less
  experimental.

  - Starting some minutes ago, I now upload the curl development archive here
  automatically on daily basis. It is a sort-of poor-man's CVS. They're
  strictly development material, ask your parents before you <a
  href="beta/">try them!</a><br>

  - The zlib stuff proved to be a hard nut to crack. So hard I'm currently
  halting that branch of the project and thus I believe I can release a new
  stable version really soon.<br>

  - I added the <a href="docs/copyright.html">copyright</a> page as well as
  improved the navigation menu to the left of here to not have a link to the
  currently shown pages.

  And the win32 openssl DDLs were moved again, thanks Zhibiao Wu and Douglas

  We still haven't got <i>any</i> reports from anyone that has tried curl on a
  site supporting compressed HTTP documents. This is one of the reasons
  6.1beta was uploaded...!

  for win32 openssl DLLs.<br>

  - Albert Chin-A-Young &lt;china@thewrittenword.com&gt; pointed me to the
  site hosted by The Written Word that holds a wide selection of pre-compiled
  curl binaries. The <a href="download.html">download page</a> is updated!

  Yet another one of those "free software sites" has popped up, on this you

  The visible changes to the web pages should be pretty
  obvious. As more and more info is stuffed into these pages, I felt I had to
  rearrange them a bit and this is the result. It doesn't look very beautiful,
  I know, but I'm not a web designer or anything. At least there's a lot of
  relevant information here.
