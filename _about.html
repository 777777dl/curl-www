<ul>
 <li> maintained and edited by <a href="http://daniel.haxx.se/">Daniel

<p>
 The box running <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl.haxx.se</a> is...
<ul>
 <li> hosted by <a href="http://www.contactor.se/">Contactor Data AB</a>
 <li> running Apache 1.3.x on a Sun Enterprise 250 machine
 <li> hooked to a 2 Mbit/sec connection
 <li> using a subdomain provided by <a href="http://www.haxx.se/">Haxx</a>
 <li> serving around 10000 unique hosts that download about 2.5GB of data - every week.
</ul>

<p>
 The main technologies used when creating this site are:
<ul>
 <li> Daniel's cpp that all static pages are preprocessed with when generated
 <li> standard unix make for dependency-stuff
 <li> perl for the dynamic pages and most background scripting
 <li> hypermail for all the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/mail/">mail archives</a>
 <li> LXR for the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source">source indexing</a> magic
 <li> htdig for the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/search/">search engine</a>
 <li> some pages use SSI instructions for dynamic creations
 <li> Daniel's statistics scripts generate weekly usage summaries
 <li> man2html by Earl Hood converts the man pages to HTML
 <li> txt2html by Seth Golub converts some plain-text files to HTML
 <li> curl(!) for the automaticly generated mirror links
 <li> contents are managed and distributed using CVS
</ul>

<p>
 You can "syndicate" information about the latest curl release archive by
 fetching the <a href="/info"><tt>/info</tt></a> file.  It always contains
 the latest available release-archive information.

<p>
 We hardly display any email addresses on this site without obscuring them by
 removing their '@' sign.  Research has shown that when we publish addresses in
 plaintext, we get a whole lot more spam.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

<p>
 A wide selection of services are provided by sourceforge.net for the benefit
 of curl users.<br> <A href="http://sourceforge.net"> <IMG
