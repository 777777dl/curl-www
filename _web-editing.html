TITLE(Web Site Editing Guidlines)
<p>
 <b>This document is intended for the curl web site editors only.</b>

<p>
 You need an account on sourceforge.net and that account needs to be a member
 in project curl. You check out the entire curl web site with:
<pre>
cvs -d [user]@cvs.curl.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/curl checkout www
</pre>

<p>
 When you've checked out the web pages from CVS, there's a file named
 'CVS-README' present which contains some hard technical facts about
 things. Read that first.


<p>
 To think of:
<ul>
 <li> The pages are preprocessed before they are finalized. The preprocessor
      is a simple C-style one, but please take care so that #if and #ifdefs
      have an ending #endif and so on.

 <li> The web site is updated from CVS every 20 minutes. If you notice a
      mistake, it will stay that way at least until next update.
</ul>

<p>
 What to edit/update?
<ul>
 <li> Add news items whenever you have interesting "news" you think the curl
      community might enjoy. The news section also serves a purpose of making
      it apparent that the site is living. Try to follow the tradition and
      style of previous news items. Note the use of the macros.

 <li> Try to keep the download page up-to-date. If new versions of packages
      mentioned on the site is available, try to make the page reflect that
      fact. Do note the use of the 'TRCURRENT' and 'TRNCURRENT' (N is for NOT)
      macros.

 <li> Edit bad language use, bad spelling or confusing use of words.

 <li> If the problem is in a page out of control from the web site, chances are
      that the page is generated automatically from a file in the source code
      archive and then <i>that</i> file could be corrected instead.
</ul>
