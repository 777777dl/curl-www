TITLE(How To Send Feedback to Developers)

<p>
 Do you have an idea for improving curl, the tool, the lib, the docs or the
 web site?  Want to suggest a new feature or an improvement to an existing
 one?  Is there aditional documentation you'd like to see?

<p> <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/mail/">join a mailing list</a> and take it there!

<p>
 The former "feedback" forum is no longer present as it was mostly abused by
 spammers and by people who should've used the lists anyway.
