SUBTITLE(Build from CVS)

<p>
 First, run these commands:

<pre>
  $ mkdir someplacenice
  $ cd someplacenice
  $ cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository login
    [enter 'phpfi' (without quotes) as password ]
  $ cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout curl
  $ ./curl/testcurl.sh
</pre>
<p>
  You'll now see a full compile, build and test perform. Make sure everything
  works out fine.

<p>
 Then, in a cron job do:
<pre>
 $ cd someplacenice
 $ ./curl/testcurl.sh | mail -s "autobuild" curl-autocompile@haxx.se
</pre>
<p>
 If mailing the info is not suitable for you, try using this <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/auto/upload.cgi">upload form</a>.

<p>
 Every once in a while, <a href="./">http://curl.haxx.se/auto/</a> gets
 updated with the available logs. <a href="stat.cgi">Recent CVS changes</a>.

SUBTITLE(Build from daily tarballs)
<p>
 If you can't checkout or update the sources from CVS easily, another approach
 to automated testing of the latest sources is made by getting the latest
 daily tarballs automaticly instead.
<p>
 This is easily done with the use of the <a href="autocurl.txt">autocurl</a>
 shell script, written by Ralph Mitchell.

SUBTITLE(Make more tests run)
<p>
 The number of tests run on some tests are not the maximum amount, but instead
 numerous ones are "skipped".
<p>
 This is because some of the tests require specal conditions that are not
 enabled everywhere. You can improve this situation by using the configure's
 --enable-debug option (which enables much more thorough memory and netrc
 debugging) and to make sure that you have stunnel installed (which enables
 HTTPS tests to run).
