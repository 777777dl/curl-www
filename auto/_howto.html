SUBTITLE(Get a Fresh Check-out from CVS)
<p>
 First, run these commands:

<pre>
  $ mkdir someplacenice
  $ cd someplacenice
  $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cool.haxx.se:/cvsroot/curl login
    [enter return when prompted for password ]
  $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cool.haxx.se:/cvsroot/curl checkout curl
  $ ./curl/tests/testcurl.pl
</pre>
<p>
 The first time to run testcurl.pl, it'll prompt you for some info. That info
 is then stored in the file named 'setup' in the current directory and will be
 used when this script is subsequently run. The format is easily manually
 edited using a text editor.
<p>
 You'll now see a full compile, build and test perform. Make sure everything
 works out fine.

<p>
 Then, in a cron job do:
<pre>
 $ cd someplacenice
 $ ./curl/tests/testcurl.pl | mail -s "autobuild" curl-autocompile@haxx.se
</pre>
<p>
 If mailing the info is not suitable for you, try using this <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/auto/upload.cgi">upload form</a>.

SUBTITLE(Build from daily tarballs)
<p>
 If you can't checkout or update the sources from CVS easily, another approach
 to automated testing of the latest sources is made by getting the latest <a
 href="http://cool.haxx.se/curl-daily/">daily tarballs</a> automaticly
 instead.
<p>
 This is easily done with the use of the <a href="autocurl.txt">autocurl</a>
 shell script, written by Ralph Mitchell.

SUBTITLE(Make more tests run)
<p>
 The number of tests run on some tests are not the maximum amount, but instead
 numerous ones are "skipped".
<p>
 This is because some of the tests require specal conditions that are not
 enabled everywhere. You can improve this situation by using the configure's
 --enable-debug option (which enables much more thorough memory and netrc
 debugging) and to make sure that you have stunnel installed (which enables
 HTTPS tests to run).
