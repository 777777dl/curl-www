<p>
 If you feel like helping out the project, have a peek here and see what
 autobuilds we would appreciate to get going!

<p> 

We have no automatic building/testing on these platforms:

<ul>
 <li> AmigaOS
 <li> BeOS
 <li> Hurd
 <li> Mac OS X
 <li> Novell Netware
 <li> OS/2
 <li> OpenBSD
 <li> QNX
 <li> RiscOS
 <li> SCO Unix
 <li> VMS
</ul>

<p> 
 We lack building/testing for these platforms/options:
<ul>
 <li> NetBSD - only partly working tests for NetBSD on Sparc now
 <li> Windows - only MSVC builds tested and no test cases run
 <li> Linux on other archs than i386 and Sparc
</ul>
