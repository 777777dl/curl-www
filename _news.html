  I've talked about this a lot on the mailing list and I've previously posted

  a dual license, where the user may opt for the previous MPL license or the
  new very liberal MIT/X-derivate license. Using the latter license will make
  curl and libcurl "GPL compatible" and thus there are no longer anything that
  prevents them from being used as components in pure GPLed projects.

  moved this site from being on a sub page of my personal home page a few
  years ago (like blabla.se/~dast/curl). I then thought it would be cool to
  make the new site work on both places. Later, I've realized that it is no
  good since many search engines and similar still index that old location and
  it makes some users to enter through there and it takes away somewhat from
  my efforts of using this curl-ified site name.

  I'll tell you one of the plagues about releasing software for Windows: there

  extract information from those few big ones every once in a while. Since
  those "mother-sites" are very slow at updating their information (monster
  huge sites like download.com and winfiles.com), all the windows sites keep
  very old information. There isn't much I can do. People will probably
  continue getting curl 6.0 until I delete it from the site... I try to update
  the information at some of the biggest sites that point poeple here, but
  they're dead slow or just plain ignorant.

 NSUBJ(libcurl docs in the pipe)
 NDATE(25 May 2000)
 NCOLS 

  I've started to produce some documentation around the new libcurl
  interface. They're gonna be man pages and on this web site, they appear over
  on the <a href="/libcurl/docs/">libcurl docs pages</a>. Have an early
  peek. It really isn't much yet.

 NSUBJ(win32 openssl binaries here)
 NDATE(24 May 2000)
 NCOLS 

  I get so many questions about where to find the win32 versions of the
  precompiled openssl libraries so I asked Jörn Hartroth to bring them to me
  and now I have a link to them from the <a href="download.html">download
  page</a>.

 NSUBJ(freshmeat speeds things up)

  So I posted the news about curl 7 beta on <a

  people have downloaded beta archives! :-)

 NSUBJ(Extensive renaming of libcurl symbols)
 NDATE(22 May 2000)
 NCOLS
  
  To give you a taste of the new names in libcurl, I felt I should upload a <a
  href="/beta/">new beta</a>. I'll try to keep them coming pretty frequently
  now, why I won't always bother to make noise about every single new release.
 <p>
  Jörn Hartroth brought me a win32-binary of that beta that I also put on the
  beta download page. Have fun.

 NSUBJ(Version seven is now head CVS branch)
 NDATE(22 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  I have now applied all the changes to the main branch in <a
  href="cvs.html">CVS</a> and I'll try not to look back too much in the
  mirror. All new development will be made on the v7-line of sources, and
  they'll be a bit easier to get off the CVS server now. No need to specify
  any extra labels.

 NSUBJ(Slow beta feedback)
 NDATE(22 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  It's been four days since I uploaded the 7.0 beta release here, and so far
  exactly nobody has told me if it works, or if it isn't. Very few persons
  have actually downloaded it. I need your help friends, please get it and try
  it!

 NSUBJ(First version seven beta)
 NDATE(18 May 2000)

  Get your copy of the <a href="/beta/">Curl 7 beta</a>. Read the CHANGES

  and feel free to comment the changes.

 NSUBJ(Other ports)
 NDATE(16 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  I discovered a chinese site that features what seems to be a mirror of a HP
  freeware site and they have up-to-date <a href="download.html#hpux">curl
  packages</a>. If you know of other sites that do this kind of work, please
  let me know.

 NSUBJ(Download stats)
 NDATE(16 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  Around 1000 copies a week are downloaded from this site, all different
  archives combined. I think it is pretty interesting since it was a while
  since the latest release.

 NSUBJ(Planning for libcurl 7)
 NDATE(12 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  I've made a lot of work on the internals of the lib now, and <a
  href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/1594/0/3729648/">this is
  what to expect</a> for the nearest future. Bring me your feedback, ideas and
  opinions!

 NSUBJ(Library design philosophy)
 NDATE(12 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  I posted a <a
  href="http://curl.haxx.se/archive-2000-05/0037.html">discussion material</a>
  to the mailing list regarding how to deal with portable functions the lib
  features internally, that has nothing to do with URL transfers, but that the
  application might want to feature as well. Subscribe, join in, take part!

 NSUBJ(FTP)
 NDATE(10 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  FTP style URLs. The directory part of FTP URLs were not treated
  properly. Now I make sure to URL-decode <i>after</i> I've separated the path
  into directory and file name. I've also changed the way curl performs now,
  in that it will now make a CWD to the specified directory and there it will
  make the operation on the file. This also has the benefit that ftp upload
  will work better on the funet FTP server (I mean the actual software, not
  that particular site).

 NSUBJ(porting)
 NDATE(10 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  A system turned up that curl didn't compile very well on. strcasecmp(), ldap
  defines and it requires <b>two</b> libs for gethostbyname() to link got me
  busy for a while.

 NSUBJ(libcurl 7 moves)

  I've actually fetched both FTP and HTTP documents using the new to-become
  library. It isn't really there yet, but it crawls in the right direction...

 NSUBJ(let it become libcurl 7!)
 NDATE(27 Apr 2000)
 NCOLS

  I didn't come up with any ideas nor did anyone else present any that made my
  hair rise. So, as some pointed out, instead we go with the somewhat familiar
  name 'libcurl' and just call the new design version 7. There has been some
  discussions about it and you can now see parts of it in the CVS.

 NSUBJ(CVS branch newlib)
 NDATE(26 Apr 2000)
 NCOLS

  I created a branch in the CVS for the new lib experiments. 'newlib' is the
  new tag. To checkout this, checkout as normal and after the checkout
  command, you issue <tt>cvs update -rnewlib</tt>. Volia, you'll then get my
  very early stuff.  <b>Warning</b> it is not working, if it even compiles for
  you...

 NSUBJ(Decrease amount of spam)
 NDATE(26 Apr 2000)
 NCOLS

  To make the email addresses posted on these web pages a little less likely
  to be extracted by robots and used for spam, I've replaced all @-signs in
  the email addresses with '_at_'.
