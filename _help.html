TITLE(We Need Your Help)
<p>
 The curl project depends on volountary work by skilled people. We depend on
 work by many different people for this to develop. Time and resources are
 scarce for all of us, of course, so if we share the burden we can reach further
 and create a better product. This list contains some of the stuff we need
 help with right now.
<p>
 You can have a look at the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=976">task list</a>, too, and the <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/todo.html">TODO list</a> I try to maintain!

<p>
<b>web site</b><br> The web site is continously growing and getting an extra
 set of hands to keep things up-to-date and valid would be good...

<p>
<b>test suite</b><br>
<ul>
 <li> Fix the perl HTTP server to work with persistent connections
 <li> Fix the perl FTP server to work with persistent connections.
 <li> More test cases (especially that exercise persistent connections.
      We might need to improve the whole test suite for this.)
</ul>

<b>misc improvements</b><br>
<ul>
 <li> IPv6 support (passive FTP support still has to be done)
 <li> SSL session ID caching
 <li> New cookie jar handling
 <li> Non-blocking connects
 <li> asynch name resolving (to allow full Win32 timeout support)
 <li> zlib support. It should be buffer-based decompression and it should work
  with the three main compression types HTTP documents can be compressed with.
 <li> C++ wrappers for the interface
</ul>

<p>
 Of course, if you're willing to help and have other ideas for what to improve,
 fix or add, get in touch and we'll discuss it!
