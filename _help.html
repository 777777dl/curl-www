TITLE(We Need Your Help)
<p>
 The curl project depends on voluntary work by skilled people. We depend on
 work by many different people for this to develop. Time and resources are
 scarce for all of us, of course, so if we share the burden we can reach
 further and create a better product. This list contains some of the stuff we
 need help with right now.
<p>
 Have a look at the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/todo.html">TODO list</a>
 we try to maintain!

<p>
<b>test suite</b><br>
<ul>
 <li> Fix the perl HTTP server to work with persistent connections
 <li> Fix the perl FTP server to work with persistent connections.
 <li> More test cases (especially that exercise persistent connections.
      We need to improve the whole test suite for this.)
 <li> add TELNET tests
 <li> add LDAP tests
</ul>

<b>misc improvements</b><br>
<ul>
 <li> documentation (all over basically)
 <li> the new multi interface
 <li> asynch name resolving
 <li> zlib support. It should be buffer-based decompression and it should work
  with the three main compression types HTTP documents can be compressed with.
 <li> C++ wrappers for the interface
</ul>

<p>
 Of course, if you're willing to help and have other ideas for what to improve,
 fix or add, get in touch and we'll discuss it!
