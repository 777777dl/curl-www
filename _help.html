TITLE(We Need Your Help)
<p>
 The curl project depends on voluntary work by skilled people. We depend on
 work by many different people for this to develop. Time and resources are
 scarce for all of us, of course, so if we share the burden we can reach
 further and create a better product. This list contains some of the stuff we
 need help with right now.

<p>
<b>improvements</b><br>
<ul>
 <li> Have a look at the <a href="/docs/todo.html">TODO list</a> we try to
 maintain!
 <li> fix <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=976">open bugs</a>!
 <li> <a href="http://daniel.haxx.se/resolver/">portable asynch name resolving</a>
</ul>

<b>test related</b><br>
<ul>
 <li> Fix the perl FTP server to work with persistent connections.
 <li> More test cases (especially that exercise persistent connections.
      We need to improve the whole test suite for this.)
 <li> add TELNET tests
 <li> add LDAP tests
</ul>

<p>
 Of course, if you're willing to help and have other ideas for what to improve,
 fix or add, get in touch and we'll discuss it!
