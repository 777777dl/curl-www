TITLE(We Need Your Help)
<p>
 The curl project depend on volountary work by skilled persons. We depend on
 work by many different people for this to develop. Time and resources are
 scarce for everyone of us, so if we share the burdens we can reach further
 and create a better product. This list contains some of the stuff we need
 help with right now.
<p>
 Also, have a look at the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=976">task list</a> and the <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/todo.html">TODO list</a> I try to maintain!

<p>
<b>test suite</b><br>
<ul>
 <li> Fix the perl HTTP server to work with persistant connections
 <li> Fix the perl FTP server to work with persistant connections.
 <li> more test cases (especially that excersise the persistant connections.
      We might need to improve the whole test suite for this.)
</ul>

<b>various persistant connections updates</b><br>
<ul>
 <li> Add more example source codes that use persistant connections
</ul>

<b>misc improvements</b><br>
<ul>
 <li> IPv6 support (passive FTP support is still left)
 <li> SSL session ID caching
 <li> asynch name resolving (to allow full win32 timeout support)
 <li> zlib support. It should be buffer-based decompression and it should work
  with the three main compression types HTTP documents can be compressed with.
 <li> C++ wrappers for the interface
</ul>

<p>
 Of course, if you're willing to help and have other ideas of what to improve,
 fix or add, get in touch and we'll discuss it!
