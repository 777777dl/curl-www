              libcurl TFTP Packet Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
              =================================================

Project cURL Security Advisory, March 20th 2006
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html

1. VULNERABILITY

libcurl uses the given file part of a TFTP URL in a manner that allows a
malicious user to overflow a heap-based memory buffer due to the lack of
boundary check.

This overflow happens if you pass in a URL with a TFTP protocol prefix
("tftp://"), using a valid host and a path part that is longer than 512 bytes.

The affected flaw can be triggered by a redirect, if curl/libcurl is told to
follow redirects and an HTTP server points the client to a tftp URL with the
characteristics described above.

There is no known exploit at the time of this writing.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2006-1061 to this issue.

2. AFFECTED VERSIONS

Affected versions: curl and libcurl 7.15.0 to and including 7.15.2
Not affected versions: curl and libcurl 7.14.1 and earlier, 7.15.3 and later

libcurl 7.15.1 and 7.15.2 contain code that prevents this code from being
executed on architecures where a struct is not of the same assumed packed size
it has on x86, thus they are not vulnerable. For exact details on this, please
review the code and patch.

Also note that (lib)curl is used by many applications, and not always
advertised as such.

3. RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately:

 I - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.15.3

 II - Apply the patch http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-tftp.patch to your
      libcurl version and install this

 III - Build curl with TFTP disabled with configure --disable-tftp

4. TIME LINE

We were notified by Ulf Harnhammar on March 10th, 2006. His notification email
contained a valid patch.

Daniel didn't read the mail until the 12th due to vacations.
