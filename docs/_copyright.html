 I often get a lot of questions about curl's legal status and what requirements
 it defines. This is just a short summary:
<p>
<ul><font size="+1">
 Curl and libcurl are true <b>Open Source/Free Software</b> and meet all
 definitions as such. It means that you are free to modify and redistribute
 all contents of the curl distributed archives.
<p>
 You may also freely use curl and libcurl in your commercial projects.
</font></ul>
<p>
 Curl and libcurl are licensed under a <a href="MITX.txt">MIT/X derivate
 license</a> <b>or</b> the Mozilla Public License, the <i>MPL</i>. Try the <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/FAQ.html">MPL license FAQ</a>. More about
 the <a href="/legal/">dual license</a> in that separate section.
<p>
 Curl and libcurl does not contain <i>any</i> GPL source. I don't agree with
 the "viral" aspects of GPL. Another reason it doesn't contain GPL source is
 that it would limit users of libcurl.
<p>
 For many of the most common questions regarding curl and using curl with your
 [differently licensed] program, have a look at the license section of the <a
 href="faq.shtml">FAQ</a>.
<p>
 There are <b>other</b> computer-related projects using the name curl as well.

 name issue</a>.
