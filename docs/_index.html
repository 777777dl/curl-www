<p>
 <I>Please</i>, if you find errors, bad wording or just miss items in these
 documents, correct them and mail me the updated version! You find the ASCII
 versions of all of them in the release tarballs. I am always interested in
 more and better documents. I need you to help me.

<p>
 Some of these documents are converted to HTML using a txt2html tool, why some
 of the formatting gets a little odd. I still consider them to be useful and
 the conversion saves me from a lot of extra work trying to maintain the same
 info at several places...

<p>
 You find the absolutely most updated documentation when browsing the <a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/curl/curl/docs/">curl
 CVS docs repository</a>.
