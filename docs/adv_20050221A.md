Kerberos Authentication Buffer Overflow
=======================================

Project curl Security Advisory, February 21st 2005 -
[Permalink](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20050221A.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

Due to bad usage of the base64 decode function to a stack-based buffer without
checking the data length, it was possible for a malicious FTP server to
overflow the client during krb4 negotiation. I don't know of any single user
that uses krb4-ftp and I'm not even sure it still works 100%. The
[announcement](http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=203) was
done without contacting us.
