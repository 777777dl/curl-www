What feature/bug fix would you like to see the project implement next?
I'd really like to be able to use curl as a raw tcp socket too (with optional ssl) easily support [] chars in urls without them being interpreter as a range. from the CLI. Rsync copy, delta is not needed Continue your excellent support of http and https in the areas of ipv6 and SPDY Support for the WinRT-Platform like it is proposed by https://github.com/martell/libcurl-winrt Session multiplexing made easy. Applications over ssh as a transport. Recursive down/uploads for [s]ftp No feature request, but a big thank you! Curious about latest http/1.1 update in relation to libcurl. Ability to generate more than 2 threads for FTP transfer. Better polling api. the progress bar does not always show up when the file is downloaded 100% I think we could have a little more examples. The ones in the website are very basic. The new stuff seems to not be there sometimes... I hope to be able to contribute more with libcurl in a near future. Review defaults for non functional reasons. e.g. Connection handling: timeouts tend to be far too long, allowing software developers that don't consider such things to freely sink servers. Fall fast, and make people override where there's just reason... control of curl internal buffer sizes, including option to release the buffer when not needed (such as when waiting for server response). buffer pool would be a good approach (as done with openssl MODE_RELEASE_BUFFER). I think the CLI of curl is clunky, some effort should be put into modernizing it. But maybe it's just the documentation. I only use curl for simple stuff, because of the bad doc I consider PUT/POST something complicated with curl. But you know what, many libraries in that field are overly complicated. Go's http client is cool ;) ZeroMQ support up-to-date windows binaries by knauf, lol wget/httrack -like (and js/css/font/etc -aware) addon in the bundle for recursive fetching More of the same - I think things are ticking along nicely. Docs and tutorial about non HTTP/ftp s protocols. How to work with imap/smtp/telnet ... Ability to use wildcard and download multiple files without any need for additional programming. Keep up the good work Daniel and co's! Finer control over HTTP Digest authentication, connection reuse, pipelining. Better support for windows protocols like ldap and socks This survey should have a "no basis for judgement" option for the "How good is the project and its members to handle..." section. There should be a list of constants for option numbers, etc. instead of macros: for languages that don't understand them it's laborious to translate them. Fix the problem where header files became platform/architecture dependent (a few years ago), making cross-builds cumbersome even in such a simple scenario as building 32-bit libcurl on a 64-bit Linux system. It would seem to be a better solution to detect bitness and other platform dependent stuff dynamically inside the headers at compile-time. [Sorry if this was sorted out since.] Otherwise a very satisfied user here, curl/libcurl are key components. Happy to see that distros picked up on updates recently. It would be nice to get json support in cli Honestly, curl/libcurl already has support for everything that I want so far. The one time that it didn't support something (XOAUTH2), I was able to implement it easily. The process took less than a week from start to finish, and that is with having never seen the curl source prior, and with me being a rather novice programmer. My thanks goes out to the project founders, leads and contributors! Easier method attachment I use Pan for NNTP(S), post large binaries etc with the 'yencee' Perl script found on Sourceforge with my own modifications. I use wget for Shoutcast / Icecast streams (seems good enough, haven't tried curl). The main problem with NNTP(S) is the posting phase: we might get an error (usually network) that will require a 'retransmission' at the interrupted point, we've been able to recode parts of 'yencee' to handle some kinds of this, but I'd much rather have a 'fully native' proggie written in C (not C++ nor any scripting language if at all possible). I've used Apple (and before that it was the CoCo3 with several 3rd-party contraptions and an Atari-ST, both running the Microware OS-9 system). But lately IMO Apple has become a hated company mainly because they disagree with some of the f/oss licenses (mainly GNU as it appears to me). So instead of spending my money to upgrade my iMac (they refuse to allow the versions of OSX past 10.7 to run on it), I am already researching a good system to build/buy on my own, I am not going to give them any more of my meager disability/retirement allotments. Sorry this got so long-winded but I really need to say these things to a wide audience as possible. Thank you. libcurl doesn't work at all with Windows SSPI when Negotiate proxy auth is enabled and a Microsoft Forefront Threat Management Server 2010 proxy is used - bug #1363 colored output SRV records in HTTP2 implementation. Implement Mark Andrews' draft. It will push things forward. My only preference would be if you could offer a generic make file that would come close to working on common systems. I am using mingw-w64 on 64-bit windows. I don't use automake because it introduces a bunch of new dependencies, but it appears that automake is the only build mechanism supported for my environment. I managed to find a pre-compiled mingw-w64 version of libcurl elsewhere, and if I had not, I probably would not have used libcurl. (Although my application was developed on windows, it runs also on linux, and its libcurl file access has been use to a limited extent on linux. The standard libcurl package for that linux distribution worked out of the box with my application.) SPDY Full speed file transfers across all protocols, and continued development of mail handling protocols. Easier build instructions for curl w/NSS on Windows. That seems rather harder than it should be. I used easy interface for a long time, but once tried multy for the one of my C++ projects and had a lot of problems with it. There are was a race condition in host resolving and main thread on Windows, so all FTP connections failed. Latest release seems to fix it, but another bug has appeared - url_open example, on which based my FTP streaming solution, stop working with latest libcurl on Windows. There are infinite loop in socket reading. So I stop using multy interface at all and switch to easy interface with my own threading implementation. I was very surprised as there are so buggy multy interface implementation on Windows. The same code works great on Unix. So I discovered libcurl is not so good for crossplatform development Cifs support More vigilant tracking/updating of the examples when the API changes. (e.g. examples using deprecated functions) My biggest issue is that the key feature I need is only available with the OpenSSL backend. For my application (and frankly most others, they just don't actually care enough), it's essential to be able to control validation of the server's key while setting up a TLS connection. Without that feature, use of TLS is completely unsafe for applications, and right now that's OpenSSL only. So the portability to other back-ends is both not useful, and has actually caused bugs in the OpenSSL back-end because of the complexity of supporting the others. World domination! HTTPS: Live CRL checking and OCSP. HTTPS: Some type of certificate pinning and/or a generic way to evaluate the certificate chain (independent of SSL backend) would be neat. Thanks for all your work on this project. libcurl tcl api crashes in a mysterious manner when -bodyvar and -file options are both used, even at different times with the same handle. There are a couple other options which are surprisingly mutually exclusive, and not documented as such.
