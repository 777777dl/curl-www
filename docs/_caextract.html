TITLE(Automatically converted CA Certs from mozilla.org)
<div class="relatedbox">

</div>
<p>
 We provide automated conversions. The output CA bundle file in PEM format is
 available from here:

 <ul>
 <li> <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem">cacert.pem</a> (~250KB)
 <li> <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem.gz">cacert.pem.gz</a> (~130 KB)
 <li> <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem.bz2">cacert.pem.bz2</a> (130 KB)
</ul>
<p>
 The PEM file contains the datestamp of the conversion and we try to only
 convert if there's a change in either the script or the source file.

<p>
 These ca cert bundles do not contain the <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates">DigiNotar
 certificates</a> as Mozilla marks them as untrusted and this script knows the
 markup for that, <b>but</b> it may contain related certificates that Mozilla
 (and others) would block using other means. (Like some certs that were
 cross-signed by Entrust etc). See details in <a
 href="https://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/1178/">bug #1178</a>.

SUBTITLE(The mk-ca-bundle.pl script)
<p>
 The <a href="mk-ca-bundle.html">mk-ca-bundle</a> tool converts <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>'s <a
 href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt">CA
 cert bundle</a> to PEM format, suitable for (lib)curl and others. Writtten by
 Guenter Knauf.

SUBTITLE(Requirements)
<o>
 It is a perl script.  The script uses the 'openssl' tool and it requires the
 version that comes with the 0.9.7 series or later.
<p>
 The exact Mozilla file needed for this job is found within that script.

SUBTITLE(CA bundle license)
<p>
 This new file is only a converted version of the original one and thus it is
 licensed under the same licenses as the Mozilla source file: MPL 1.1, GPL
 v2.0 or LGPL 2.1

SUBTITLE(Convert from your local Firefox installation)

<p> You can also extract the ca certs off your Firefox installation, if you
 just have the 'certutil' tool installed and run the <a href="http://github.com/bagder/curl/blob/master/lib/firefox-db2pem.sh">firefox-db2pem.sh</a> script!
