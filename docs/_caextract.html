<p>
 We provide automated conversions. The output CA bundle file in PEM format
 (250KB) is available from here over HTTPS:

<p>
 <big><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem">cacert.pem</a></big>

<p>
 The PEM file contains the datestamp of the conversion and we try to only
 convert if there's a change in either the script or the source file.

SUBTITLE(CA cert bundle license)
<p>
 The PEM file is only a converted version of the original one and thus it is
 licensed under the same license as the Mozilla source file: MPL 2.0

SUBTITLE(Automated downloads from here)
<p>
 We don't mind you downloading the converted file from us in an automated
 fashion, but please only do it once per day. It is only updated once every
 few months anyway.

SUBTITLE(The conversion script mk-ca-bundle)
<p>
 The <a href="mk-ca-bundle.html">mk-ca-bundle</a> tool
 converts <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>'s cert bundle to PEM
 format, suitable for (lib)curl and others.

SUBTITLE(Convert from your local Firefox installation)

<p> You can also extract the ca certs off your Firefox installation, if you
 just have the 'certutil' tool installed and run
 the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/firefox-db2pem.sh">firefox-db2pem.sh</a>
 script!
