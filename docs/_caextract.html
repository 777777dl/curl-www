TITLE(Extract CA Certs from Mozilla)
<p>
 Roland Krikava provided this very useful script that builds a CA cert bundle
 useful for curl, by extracting information provided in the <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> source tree. The Mozilla file
 needed for this job is named
 "/mozilla/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt".

<p>
 <a href="parse-certs.txt">parse-certs.sh</a> is a shell script with an
 embedded Ruby script. You thus need to have Ruby installed to make this work.

<p>
 <b>Note:</b> the script uses the 'openssl' tool and it requires the version
 that comes with the 0.9.7 series.
