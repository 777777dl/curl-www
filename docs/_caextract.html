<p>
 Roland Krikava provided this very useful script that builds a CA cert bundle
 useful for curl, by extracting information provided in the <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> source tree. The Mozilla file
 needed for this job is named
 <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt">/mozilla/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt</a>.

<p>
 <a href="parse-certs.txt">parse-certs.sh</a> is a shell script with an
 embedded Ruby script. You thus need to have Ruby installed to make this work.

<p>
 <b>Note:</b> the script uses the 'openssl' tool and it requires the version
 that comes with the 0.9.7 series.

SUBTITLE(We Did This For You)
<p>
 We run a script regularly that makes this conversion automatically. The
 output CA bundle file in PEM format is available from here: <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem">cacert.pem</a> (~320KB) and <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem.gz">cacert.pem.gz</a> (~113 KB).
<p>
 The output file contains the datestamp of the conversion.

SUBTITLE(License)
<p>
 This new file is only a converted version of the original one and thus it is
 licensed under the same licenses: MPL or GPL v2.
