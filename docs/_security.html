<p>
  curl offers a command line option --remote-header-name (also usable as -J)
  which will use the file name of the Content-disposition: header when it
  saves the downloaded data locally.

  curl attempts to cut off the directory parts from any given file name in the
  header to only store files in the current directory. It will overwrite a
  local file using the same name as the header specifies.

  The stripping of the directory did not take backslashes into account.

 When downloading compressed content over HTTP and the app as asked libcurl to
 automatically uncompress it with the CURLOPT_ENCODING option, libcurl could
 wrongly provide the callback with more data than what the maximum documented
 amount. An application could thus get tricked into badness if the maximum
 limit was trusted to be enforced by libcurl itself (as it is documented).

<p>
   SSL and TLS Server certificates contain one or more fields with server name
  or otherwise matching patterns. These strings are stored as content and
  length within the certificate, and thus there is no particular terminating
  character.
<p>
  curl's OpenSSL interfacing code did faulty assumptions about those names and
  patterns being zero terminated, allowing itself to be fooled in case a
  certificate would get a zero byte embedded into one of the name fields. To
  illustrate, a name that would show this vulnerability could look like:
<p>
<pre>
    "example.com\0.haxx.se"
</pre>
<p>
  This cert is thus made for "haxx.se" but curl would erroneously verify it
  with no complaints for "example.com".
<p>
  According to a recently published presentation, this kind of zero embedding
  has been proven to be possible with at least one CA.

<p>
  When told to follow a "redirect" automatically, libcurl does not question
  the new target URL but will follow to any new URL that it understands. As
  libcurl supports FILE:// URLs, a rogue server can thus "trick" a
  libcurl-using application to read a local file instead of the remote one.
<p>
  This is a problem, for example, when the application is running on a server
  and is written to upload or to otherwise provide the transfered data to a
  user, to another server or to another application etc, as it can be used to
  expose local files it was not meant to.
<p>
  The problem can also be exploited for uploading, if the rogue server
  redirects the client to a local file and thus it would (over)write a local
  file instead of sending it to the server.
<p>
  libcurl compiled to support SCP can get tricked to get a file using embedded
  semicolons, which can lead to execution of commands on the given
  server. "Location: scp://name:passwd@host/a'``;date >/tmp/test``;'".
<p>
  Files on servers other than the one running libcurl are also accessible when
  credentials for those servers are stored in the .netrc file of the user
  running libcurl.  This is most common for FTP servers, but can occur with
  any protocol supported by libcurl.  Files on remote SSH servers are also
  accessible when the user has an unencrypted SSH key.

<p>
libcurl (when built to use GnuTLS) fails to verify that a peer's certificate
hasn't already expired or hasn't yet become valid. This allows malicious
servers to present certificates to libcurl that won't be rejected properly.
<p>
Notably, the cacert and common name checks are still in place which reduces
the risk for random servers to take advantage of this flaw.

 libcurl's NTLM function can overflow a stack-based buffer if given a too long
 user name or domain name. This would happen if you enable NTLM authentication
 and either:
<ol>
 <li> pass in a user name and domain name to libcurl that together are longer
     than 192 bytes

 <li> allow (lib)curl to follow HTTP "redirects" (Location: and the appropriate
     HTTP 30x response code) and the new URL contains a URL with a user name
     and domain name that together are longer than 192 bytes
</ol>
