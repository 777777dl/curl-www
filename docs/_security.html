<b>Kerberos Authentication Buffer Overflow</b>
<br>
  February 21, 2005 <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/12616">BID

  href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0490">CAN-2005-0490</a> <br>
  Affected versions: 7.3 to and including 7.13.0<br>
  Not affected versions: 7.13.1 and later
<p>
  Due to bad usage of the base64 decode function to a
  stack-based buffer without checking the data length, it was possible for a
  malicious FTP server to overflow the client during krb4 negotiation. I don't
  know of any single user that uses krb4-ftp and I'm not even sure it still
  works 100%. The <a

  was done without contacting us.

<p> <b>NTLM Authentication Buffer Overflow</b><br>

  February 21, 2005 <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/12615">BID
  12615</a> <a
  href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0490">CAN-2005-0490</a><br>
  Affected versions: 7.10.6 to and including 7.13.0<br>
  Not affected versions: 7.13.1 and later
 <p>
  Due to bad usage of the base64 decode function to a stack-based buffer
  without checking the data length, it was possible for a malicious HTTP
  server to overflow the client during NTLM negotiation. The <a
  href="http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=202">announcement</a>
  was done without contacting us.

<p> <b>Proxy Authentication Header Information Leakage</b><br>

  August 3, 2003 <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8432">BID 8432</a><br>
  Affected versions: 7.1 to and including 7.10.6<br>
  Not affected versions: 7.10.7 and later
<p>
  When curl connected to a site via an HTTP proxy with the CONNECT request, the
  user and password used for the proxy connection was also sent off to the
  remote server.

<p> <b>FTP Server Response Buffer Overflow</b><br>

  October 13, 2000 <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1804">BID
  1804</a> <a
  href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2000-0973">CVE-2000-0973</a> <br>
  Affected versions: 6.0 (and possibly earlier) to and including 7.4<br>
  Not affected versions: 7.4.1 and later
<p>
  When storing an FTP server's error message on failure, there was no check
  for input length and thus a malicious FTP server could overflow curl's stack
  based buffer. <a
