SUBTITLE(libcurl NTLM Buffer Overflow)
<p>
  October 13, 2005<br>
  Mitre: CAN-2005-3185<br>
  Affected versions: curl and libcurl 7.10.6 to and including 7.14.1<br>
  Not affected versions: curl and libcurl 7.10.5 and earlier, 7.15.0 and later<br>
  Patch: <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-ntlmbuf.patch">libcurl-ntlmbuf.patch</a><br>
  Advisory: <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2005-10/0061.html">Project cURL Security Advisory</a>
<p>
 libcurl's NTLM function can overflow a stack-based buffer if given a too long
 user name or domain name. This would happen if you enable NTLM authentication
 and either:
<ol>
 <li> pass in a user name and domain name to libcurl that together are longer
     than 192 bytes

 <li> allow (lib)curl to follow HTTP "redirects" (Location: and the appropriate
     HTTP 30x response code) and the new URL contains a URL with a user name
     and domain name that together are longer than 192 bytes
</ol>
<p>
  There is no known exploit/malicious server at the time of this writing.

  iDEFENSE's <a
  href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.general/5064">notification
  mail</a> to us about this flaw was also sent to a public wget mailing list
  and thus became official immediately.

  Due to bad usage of the base64 decode function to a
  stack-based buffer without checking the data length, it was possible for a
  malicious FTP server to overflow the client during krb4 negotiation. I don't
  know of any single user that uses krb4-ftp and I'm not even sure it still
  works 100%. The <a

  When curl connected to a site via an HTTP proxy with the CONNECT request, the
  user and password used for the proxy connection was also sent off to the
  remote server.

  When storing an FTP server's error message on failure, there was no check
  for input length and thus a malicious FTP server could overflow curl's stack
