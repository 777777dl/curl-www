TITLE(Curl and the Year 2000)
<p>
 Curl, like other well-designed Unix software, does not suffer from a Year
 2000 issue. Unix dates are based around a 32-bit field centered around
 January 1 00:00:00 1970, with a range from Dec 13, 1901 to January 19,
 2038. We therefore anticipate no impact on any of our Unix or win32
 implementations because of this new millenium.
<p>
 You can safely trust curl to continue to work (at least date-wise) unmodified
 until early the year 2038.
