TITLE(Google Summer of Code)
<p>

 We intend to sign up to become a mentoring organization for <b>Google Summer
 of Code 2008</b>, and on this page we collect ideas that could serve as
 starting points when students want to write up a project idea for curl!

<p>
 Also note that we need volunteering mentors!

<p>
 Please suggest further projects ideas and your mentor status on the
 associated <a href="/mail/">mailing list</a>.


SUBTITLE(Ideas for Projects)
<ul>

<li> SMTP

<li> native (i.e.: library-less) LDAP(S)

<li> data: URLs?

<li> Preparing for fips accreditation (using openssl fips)?

<li> RTSP?

<li> MMS:// streams?

<li> RTMP?

<li> Complete Java integration/binding

<li> HTTP Caching<br>
  This isn't as simple a problem as it might seem as there are
  potential issues with security and also because depending on use cases, you
  will want to store the cache in different places with different sizes...
<br>
  Or rather, a "caching framework" which allows the user to define callbacks
  for actually storing the data in a filesystem, database, or whatever he
  prefers.
<br>
  Some aspects of the HTTP standard are not well-known and people are bound to
  get them wrong if they implement caching themselves, e.g. the "Vary" and
  "Etag" headers.

<li> Fix the last remaining blocking calls within libcurl?

<li> Fixing up/replacing language bindings?

<li> make the curl tool use the multi interface and allow it to do parallel transfers

</ul>
