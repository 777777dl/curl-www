  The main use for curl is when you want to get or send files automatically to
  or from a site using one of the supported protocols.
<p>
  Curl is free and <a href="docs/copyright.html">open software</a> that
  compiles under a wide variety of operating systems. Curl exists thanks to
  efforts from many authors, with <a
  href="mailto:Daniel.Stenberg_at_haxx.se">Daniel Stenberg</a> being the main
  author and project maintainer. Curl is the result of many spare-time hours
  of programming. Voluntary contributions are vital for this product! We
  appreciate <a href="help.html">your help</a>!
<p>
  The most recent stable version of curl is version __STABLE, released on
  __RELDATE.  There are currently __CURR available binary archives of the
  latest curl package, get them from the <a href="download.html">download
  page</a>.

<p>
  If you want to add URL transfer capability to your program, then the <a
  href="libcurl/">libcurl</a> file transfer library might be interesting to
  you. Libcurl has undergone a reorganization and with version 7 it has really
  grown to become useful. With your feedback, we can make it even better!
<p>
  All announcements of new versions will be done at <a
  href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/curl/">freshmeat.net</a> and to the <a
  href="mail/">mailing list</a>.
