 To allow software producers to show off that they're actually using curl or
 libcurl in their application <a href="mailto:mayday_at_vvv.tf">Henrik
 Hellerstedt</a> has been friendly enough to draw us a few pictures that can
 be used.
<p>
 Henrik has drawn the big cURL and libcURL logos as well as these smaller
 ones:
<p>
<center>
<img src="small-curl.png" width=90 height=36 alt="small curl icon">
<img src="small-border-curl.png" width=90 height=36 alt="small curl icon with border">
<img src="/libcurl/small.jpg" width=90 height=25 alt="libcurl icon">
</center>
<p>
 Thomas Deliduka made this, used as 'favicon.ico' for this site:
<img src="favicon.gif" width=16 height=16 alt="tiny cURL">

<p>
 Feel free and encouraged to use them! If you like drawing, we always
 appriciate new/more icons and images.

 Ah, right, this is what happens when you leave me playing with the GIMP:
<br>
<center>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=7 border=0 bgcolor="#000000"><tr><td>
 <img src="curl-anim.gif" width=90 height=36>
</td></td></table>
</center>
