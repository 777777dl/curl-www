TITLE(Curl version seven -- a look in the mirror)
<p>
  Let's start off with a little look in the mirror:
<p>
  <b>Curl goes way back</b>, but it didn't take long until I realized that the
  more power I added to the command line tool, the more I wanted to be able to
  use that functionality in other kinds of tools my friends or I write. I had
  to make a kind of library out of it.
<p>
  <b>I took the shortest path</b> and kind of added an entry point to a
  suitable function and I left it like that. My brother wrote some stuff that
  used it.
<p>
  <b>Quite some time later</b>, I got bothered by a fair amount of people that
  wanted better access to the lib and I divided the curl project into two
  parts, the lib and the application. It did clear the mist a little and made
  the separation a bit better, but the interface was still crude and
  unfriendly.
<p>
  <b>During the summer of 1999</b> I finally had enough. More and more people
  asked me about the lib, how to use it and what to expect from it. I felt a
  bit silly always making excuses for the way it was designed. It just had to
  be improved drastically to be really useful to other applications.
<p>
  <b>Autumn 1999</b> was spent discussing back and forth with people. I did my
  very best in getting other voluntary people to join me in this rather big
  mission, but I failed miserably and I admit that I did whine a bit about
  that fact for a few months until...
<p>
  <b>Spring 2000</b> In mid April I announced to the mailing list that I had
  now started to convert libcurl into a new internal design. Since I still
  have had very little feedback from people and supposed future users of the
  lib I had to go with what I think will be a useful API. With my possibly
  narrow thinking in mind, I had to calculate with the risk that I will have
  to correct details in the API afterwards so a critical point would be to
  remake the internals to a more flexible design that would later better allow
  changes.
<p>
  <b>Summer 2000</b> I worked on it, released a series of beta-releases that
  originally were a bit rough but pretty soon turned out to be really stable
  code that didn't cause any major bug report storms. My whole month of
  vacation in Mexico did cause a minor delay in the release schedule.
<p>
 <b>August 2000</b>. I released curl 7.1, the first non-beta version 7 release.

TITLE(What to and not to expect)
<p>
  <b>Besides libcurl</b>, version 7 doesn't offer many <b>big</b> new
  features. I've received a series of bug reports since my last released
  version 6, and all those fixes have been made in the version 7 branch (I
  don't really believe in keeping the version 6 branch alive for anything but
  perhaps to allow me to make patches against it if I find really serious
  bugs). There are also a fair number of minor changes and features added.

<p>
 <b>What works at this point</b>. (Let me just first start with saying that
 this is what I <i>want</i> working now, there may of course be many bugs left,
 since major changes have been made all over the internals.)
<ul>
 <li> The command line tool 'curl' should work exactly as it did before, with all
 known and reported bugs fixed.
 <li> curl's man page and docs should be up-to-date and correct
 <li> libcurl's "easy"-interface (the high-level interface) should work,
 <li> the lib's getenv() call is now threadsafe under win32
 <li> threadsafe name resolving calls are used if available
 <li> documentation for the easy-interface is almost done
 <li> --progress-bar (using the new progress callback of the lib)
 <li> Progress meter callback
 <li> libtool stuff
 <li> stable protocol engines with reliable transfers
</ul>
<p>
 There might be some other details mentioned on the <a
 href="changes.html">changes</a> page.

<p>
 <b>What doesn't work at this point</b><br>
<ul>
 <li> Asynchronous name resolving
</ul>
