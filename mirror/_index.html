TITLE(Mirroring Tools and Scripts)
<p>
 If you wanna mirror the curl packages, I've setup this section to collect
 information on how, as well as a few scripts and tools that'll do the job for
 you.
<p>
 The file named <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/download/curldist.txt">http://curl.haxx.se/download/curldist.txt</a>
 contains all files that should be mirrored. The list contains nothing but
 file names, and you should prepend 'http://curl.haxx.se/download/' to every
 single file in order to fetch them.
<p>
 The 'curldist.txt' file changes as soon as I release a new package or remove
 an old package. Thus, files get both added and removed from the list.

<li> <a href="display.cgi?file=mirror.pl">mirror.pl</a> by Daniel Stenberg
<li> <a href="display.cgi?file=mirror_curl.sh">mirror_curl.sh</a> by Tim Tassonis
</ul>

<p>
 If you decide to mirror the curl packages, please let me know so that I can
 properly advertise your mirror site.

 See the list of <a href="../mirrors.html">existing mirror sites</a>.
