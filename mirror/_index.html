TITLE(How To Mirror the Curl Site)
<p>
 We provide the full web site and the download packages for mirroring using
 rsync. It is both the easiest and quickest way to do this.
<p>
 You can mirror the contents at any time, using these command lines:
<pre>
  rsync -r -t --delete rsync://cool.haxx.se/curlweb curl-web-root
  rsync -t --delete rsync://cool.haxx.se/curldownload curl-web-root/download
</pre>
<p>
  The first line of course mirror the web site, while the second line mirrors
  the download packages in the download directory.
<p>
 <b>Note: I'm considering to scrap the web mirror system, only to keep the
 mirrored downloads. Stay tuned for updates on this.</b>

<p>
 See the list of <a href="../mirrors.html">existing mirror sites</a> and our
 <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/latest.cgi">download-from-mirror</a> service.

SUBTITLE(Requirements for curl Official Web Site Mirrors)
<p>
 To be recognized and advertised as an offcial curl web site mirror, these
 simple requirements must be met:
<ul>

<li> Mirror the site using rsync, as described above, at least every 24 hours.

<li> Make your local /download.html page links work (either by mirroring the
download files too, or by making them redirect the user to a working download
mirror)

<li> Use a host name that starts with "curl". Like
curl.[yourdomain].[tld]. Examples: curl.haxx.se, curl.tsuren.net,
curl.cyberservers.net.

<li> Mail your info and provide a contact email address to <a
href="mailto:curl-web@haxx.se">curl-web</a>.

</ul>
<p>
 We supervise mirrors automatically to verify that they are up-to-date, and if
 they aren't (and emailing the admin doesn't help) we stop linking to/using
 them.

SUBTITLE(Info for Mirror Admins)
<p>
 We check the age of your mirror regularly. Should your mirror appear
 out-of-date or non-responding too often we will remove it from the list of
 official mirrors.
<p>
 If you want to add a small 'hosted by [your orginazation]' link in the top or
 bottom of the HTML pages, it is OK with us and for this purpose we offer two
 strings in the HTML pages that are easily recognizable and
 search-and-replacable. Please use them instead of simply prepending or
 appending stuff so that the output HTML remains as standards compliant as
 possible.

<ul>

<li> &lt;!-- first-line-in-body --&gt; appears in a line above the curl logo
 and ad at the very top of the pages.

<li> &lt;!-- last-line-in-body --&gt; appears below the "about"-box in the
 bottom right end of the pages.

</ul>
<p>
 Both these markers can be examined on the curl.haxx.se main site live, as
 they are shown unmodified there in all HTML pages.

SUBTITLE(Your mirror mentioned)
<p>
 All web mirrors are mentioned on the <a href="/mirrors.html">mirrors.html</a>
 page. We also allow an individual logo there for the organization/company
 that runs/hosts the mirror. Your mirror will also appear on the <a
 href="http://curlm.haxx.se/">curlm.haxx.se service</a> and with the <a
 href="/latest.cgi">latest.cgi</a> download script.
<p>
 Mirrors are also mentioned with URL in the README file of all curl releases.
