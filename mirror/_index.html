TITLE(rsync)
<p>
 We offer both the full web site and the download packages for mirroring using
 rsync. It is both the easiest and quickest way to do this. Get in touch with
 <a href="mailto:curl-web_at_haxx.se">us</a> for details on how to proceed.

TITLE(Mirroring Tools and Scripts)
<p>
 If you wanna setup an old-style (that is like we did before we offered rsync
 access) download mirror for the curl packages, I've setup this section to
 collect information on how, as well as a few scripts and tools that'll do the
 job for you. If you want to mirror the whole curl web site, mail us at
 curl-web at haxx.se and we'll discuss it.
<p>
 The file named <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/download/curldist.txt">http://curl.haxx.se/download/curldist.txt</a>
 contains all files that should be mirrored. The list contains nothing but
 file names, and you should prepend 'http://curl.haxx.se/download/' to every
 single file in order to fetch them.
<p>
 The 'curldist.txt' file changes as soon as I release a new package or remove
 an old package. Thus, files get both added and removed from the list.

<p>
 If you decide to mirror the curl packages, please let me know so that I can
 properly advertise your mirror site. I also add existing mirrors to the
 'check mirrored package status' system available from <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/latest.cgi">here</a>.

 See the list of <a href="../mirrors.html">existing mirror sites</a>.
