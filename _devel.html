TITLE(Curl Development Overview)
<p>
 Of course there is constant development going on in curl land. In order to
 help out the development team, we have a set of different services setup.
<p>
 <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/auto/cvshistory.html">Recent CVS Activity</a> -
 You wanna know what happened recently in the curl CVS repository?
<p>
 <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/auto/">Automatic Builds</a> - Friendly people
 help us build curl automaticly in an automated manner so that we can verify
 that it remains buildable and working on a larger variety of platform, even
 when bigger changes are made.
<p>
 <a href="http://cool.haxx.se/curl-daily/">Daily Snapshot</a> - The latest CVS
 version of curl is automaticly packaged and uploaded every single day.
<p>
 <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/mail/">libcurl mailing list</a> - Most of the
 development talk and thoughts about how the future will become is discussed
 there. In fact, you can't be seriously interested in curl development without
 being subscribed to at least that one.
<p>
 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=976&atid=100976">Bug
 tracker</a> - people submit their found problems to the bug tracker as it
 makes it easy for the development crew to keep track of all remaining
 problems. See also the <a href="/docs/knownbugs.html">KNOWN_BUGS</a>
 document.
<p>
 <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/feedback/">Feedback forum</a> - similar to the
 bug tracker, but not really concerning bugs, the feedback forum is a place to
 stop by and read what users think of curl and the curl future.
<p>
 <a href="/docs/todo.html">TODO</a> - we try to maintain lists of what things
 you could <a href="help.html">help us with</a> and features a future curl
 release might get.
