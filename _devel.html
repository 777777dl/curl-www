TITLE(Curl Development Overview)
<p>
 Of course there is constant development going on in curl land. In order to
 help out the development team, we have a set of different services setup.
<p>
 <b>Automatic builds</b> - Friendly people help us <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/auto/">build curl automaticly</a> in an automated
 manner so that we can verify that it remains buildable and working on a
 larger variety of platform, even when bigger changes are made.
<p>
 <b>libcurl mailing list</b> - Most of the development talk and thoughts about
 how the future will become is discussed there. In fact, you can't be
 seriously interested in curl development without being <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/mail/">subscribed</a> to at least that one.
<p>
 <b>Bug tracker</b> - people submit their found problems to the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=976&atid=100976">bug
 tracker</a> at it makes it easy for the development crew to keep track of all
 remaining problems.
<p>
 <b>Feedback forum</b> - similar to the bug tracker, but not really concerning
 bugs, the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/feedback/">feedback forum</a> is a
 nice place to stop by and read what users think of curl and the curl future.
<p> 
 <b>TODO</b> - we try to maintain lists of what things you could <a
 href="help.html">help us with</a> and features a <a
 href="/docs/todo.html">future curl release might get</a>.
