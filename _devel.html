TITLE(Curl Development Overview)
<p>
 There is always development going on in the curl project.  To help out the
 development team, we provide these services´:
<ul>
<li>
 <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/auto/cvshistory.html">Recent CVS Activity</a> -
 What happened recently in the curl CVS repository?
<li>
 <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/auto/">Automatic Builds</a> - Friendly people
 help us build curl automatically so that we can verify that it builds works
 even on platforms and with options single developers may not use or have.
<li>
 <a href="http://cool.haxx.se/curl-daily/">Daily Snapshot</a> - The latest CVS
 version of curl is automatically packaged and uploaded every day.
<li>
 <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/mail/">libcurl mailing list</a> - Development
 talk and thoughts about how the future will become is discussed there.  You
 can't be seriously interested in curl development without being subscribed to
 at least that one mailing list.
<li>
 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=976&atid=100976">Bug
 tracker</a> - submit problems to the bug tracker as it makes it easy for the
 development crew to keep track of all remaining problems. See also the <a
 href="/docs/knownbugs.html">KNOWN_BUGS</a> document.
<li>
 <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/feedback/">Feedback forum</a> - similar to the
 bug tracker, but not really concerning bugs, the feedback forum is a place to
 stop by and read what users think of curl and the curl future.
<li>
 <a href="/docs/todo.html">TODO</a> - we try to maintain lists of what things
 you could <a href="help.html">help us with</a> and features a future curl
 release might get.
</ul>
